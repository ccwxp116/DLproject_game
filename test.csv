5,"The Blink Cam, as the name suggests, is indeed a camera simulator. You, as the main character of the game, you survive in the form of data, the so-called camera, you can be understood as a monitor. You have to visit different timelines, different regions, unlock different timeline recording points, and slowly understand what caused the Blink project to collapse, why did you lose your physical body and become a data life, and why do you need to access it? More timeline ... Each game update is an update of the timeline within the game. You will find that some maps will be different each time you update, so you need to take screenshots on each map to ensure that your timeline is perfectly recorded. There will be a total of 30 maps in the game, and there are 3 map updates in each period. Go explore as much as you like, collide with the unknown, and learn about the life experience of the Blink Cam. Image quality The materials used by Blink Cam are all high-definition materials, so you can make the best pictures in any Blink world Exploration If you think this is just a camera simulation game, you are wrong. In different maps, you will encounter many different objects. These objects will unlock different contents, some are notes, and some are objects. Even more amazing is that Blink Cam has a complete storyline, of course, you have to explore slowly. Custom map This mode allows you to create your favorite map and make your Blink world to show to your friends! So, everyone, it's time to Blink!",“(6分)这是款纯模拟类型的游戏。与其说是游戏，其实更贴近的应该是场景设计以及截图拍照。玩家可以在官方给出的地图中来进行截图或者拍照，同样也可以自定义场景来进行。BGM让人身心放松，如果不是占资源，做屏保也是挺不错的（笑），不过模拟类型的游戏实在无法推荐给所有人，只推荐喜欢摄影和截图的玩家购入尝试。『索组推荐等级：6+级』” 6/10 – 索然无味测评组,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/header.jpg?t=1657216241,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_bfcf655d105f64483ddf805e16b014902d2d0a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_b254dc878b8c2c94bd1c0a2f89d78201ae451b20.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_13bd9c0ddc69a726c76fa6ac44a585f9d9156969.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_3370ca58144d39cd76ede79dbe845a804f6deef8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_9ac44fe2f109745a2b087a7ecbf101e84f3d91b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_a33454a218375566d7209a9b5beb6ce0b6d5e33d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_9e42cc0ea735a66b99b3beee5a6bdbc8e1b59781.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_b726cc85bf8dc909be952c90ecd4f5a59b9c26ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_01eb1d4560302632e7ac7f6ac3c67a6840d0e3a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_c5d5e8eefb5fba5bb408c154190e826c382057e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_0432dc521bd8f0ab61f1a6a692589d1ad045d411.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_0e2fcdafafc7c0d0ab05b132eb8531ebf3c5cd9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1204360/ss_f0f42f89e7a7e3476a07ff1cde29242fb3e185f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657216241","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG,Simulation"

78,"Anuchard. It was known as a place of wonder and peace, a land of limitless bounty suspended in the heavens above. Five ancient Guardians kept it safe from all harm... Until they turned on the kingdom and its denizens. The Anuchardian paradise fell from the skies, crashing onto the surface of the world below. Only a tiny speck of an island survived the fall intact. The rest coalesced into a twisted mass of winding passages, wild magic, and vicious monsters, known simply as The Dungeon. Somewhere within, the five treasonous Guardians lay asleep. Generations passed as the few survivors eked out an existence in the Orchard, the sole village on the island, maintaining what little remains of Anuchardian magic. Farmers tend to the fields, scavengers try to pick the bones of the kingdom in the Dungeon. All await the Chosen One, the Bellwielder who will take up the Audros Bell, enter the Dungeon, and wake the Guardians from their slumber, and bring back the paradise lost: Return Anuchard to the heavens. Finally, you were judged worthy to take up the mantle of the Bellwielder. The Dungeon awaits! For everyone and everything. You are the Bellwielder and the Audros Bell is your best friend. Master the Bell! Not just as a weapon, but as a vital tool for overcoming puzzles and obstacles. It's more than just a blunt instrument of mayhem. Use its knock-back ability to smash enemies into obstacles, reposition them, and clear the way forward. Use the Bell to solve puzzles in the Dungeon. Launch projectiles, move puzzle pieces, and employ it creatively to progress! The warped, magical Dungeon houses the Guardians you need to confront in order to restore the lost kingdom of Anuchard. Brave the dangers of the Dungeon, using the Bell to knock around and defeat the enemies that infest it! Face complex puzzles and solve them, to unlock the deepest reaches of the Dungeon. Finally, confront each of the five Guardians to learn the truth of the Anuchard's fall and return the kingdom to its rightful place in the skies! As the Bellwielder, you're destined to restore Anuchard to the skies - but that doesn't mean you can't help Orchard on the way.

91,"Wacky Spores: The Chase is a colorful RPG runner which combines the strategy of turn-based battles with the taste of directly aiming your shots in an endless runner style. Story A story? Let's see... It looks like Roland, the King of the Bugs, has just stolen one of the Keeper of the Warmth from the Mushrooms. Be a hero, do hero stuff and get that artifact back! How does it sound? Gameplay Each area of the game is an endless turn-based battle in which you'll have to defeat dozens of enemies instead of the standard handful, and try to go as far as possible. In Wacky Spores: The Chase you don't just select your targets like other turn-based games, you manually aim weapons and abilities so that you can maximize the enemies hit and the damage done. Winning a battle requires simple tactical choices like deciding which character to bring in the battlefield, choosing the right weapon for the right monster, deciding when to disable enemies and when to just attack, using items and abilities, etc. When it's the enemies turn they will move, attack and cast in real time and you'll move the three characters together to dodge bullets. In every battle you collect coins by picking them up or by completing quests. The more coins you get the faster you level up unlocking more characters, weapons, artifacts etc, which in turn will push you further in every battle. What you get Easy to pick up but deep gameplay: just pick a weapon and start running. Tactical depth and manual aiming: move enemies around the battlefield to arrange them for the perfect shot, disable some of them or just obliterate them! Unlock a buckton of stuff : over 20 different enemies and bosses, 10 different characters, 12 weapons, 12 artifacts and 10 items that drastically change the way you play. Complete quests and pick up coins: how else would you unlock those goodies? Move your party in real time: position them for the next turn and dodge bullets.

127,"THERE SWINGS A SKULL The town of Pareildas stands in the center of a vast desert. Its citizens live their lives quietly. Or, at least, they once did. In recent days the speaker-gallows sprang, weedlike, in the heart of the town - and since its inception the denizens of Pareildas have been sacrificed, one by one. The electric words that spew from the gallows claim this is to staunch the blistering hatred of the vengeful sun... but the heat has only grown more and more unbearable. OUR PROTAGONISTS Anatoli works for the town train station. He dreams of leaving Pareildas, so that he might peacefully live out the rest of his life with his husband. His dreams share much in common with the blackened husks of the town's denizens that line the streets. Pyotr is an independent artist. He hopes, deeply, that he might do something to stop the hellfire slowly consuming Pareildas. But the price of stopping the natural order is immensely steep - and, of course, there's no guarantee this is a natural occurrence at all... ABOUT THE GAME There Swings a Skull: Grim Tidings is a narrative-horror game built in RPG Maker 2003 by Conor Walsh and Quinn K., with music by Leaf Let. Though the game initially released as a jam game it was so well-received - and sat so well with our team - that we decided to build it out into a full game. Conor Walsh is a professional narrative designer who has written on such titles as The Outer Worlds, A Place, Forbidden, The DreadX Collection 2, and many others. Quinn K. brought indie darling OFF to the English-speaking world and recently released the stylish and moody AN OUTCRY. We hope you enjoy our work. FEATURES A deep central narrative Gorgeous pixel and fullscreen graphics A unique, haunting soundtrack Two separate routes and a third that we dare not mention Multiple endings A hateful sun The endless ocean Death","““THERE SWINGS A SKULL” has found its very own formal language to draw attention to the brutality of the climate catastrophe. Medium and long-term effects such as droughts and heat waves are represented here by a merciless sun that can literally pulverize people. This narrative sledgehammer is countered by the individual characters and their interaction with the world. In a short time, players witness how people stop dreaming, how they project their fears and how their facades crumble in the face of impending doom. All this happens in such a poetic way that it makes you ache.” The Game Curator “All of this surreal oddity and foreboding doom gives There Swings a Skull a very different feel from most horror games.... the town is the monster – a horrifying sun-baked purgatory that has no escape. Madness and death are the only things that flourish there and it looks like you’re headed towards one or the other. Highly recommended.” Alpha Beta Gamer “...the game is... memorably strange, molding together its eccentric ideas with pixel art in sallow colors.” Fanbyte",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/header.jpg?t=1663267807,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_453e2319c5262e04f93e352c3b9c88b99b4f301d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_b7e2f1a21bab620b34bbcf5c0d8ae661de2ffe03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_db1ca49634cd72e2567ace0630f9a2e182042887.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_087b2b6161b19cc3d5e10fccf57f35aa51a4362a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_0d25985caa750e60116cdb29b91d0106e6f13c7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_34560925fd54a10eb5c48508aaa58ec9975934b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_a3bef8e31c8a67b83c638164c8c38fc62af4ddfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_badc87e29265cfc6bff6bb3c76220d586f26827d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_1a9914abe3f323248f7a96c34e8f3d03a74b6115.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_7396c1ff88da811f6c41fec380a70b531a3bba0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807","Casual,Indie"

Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations.

292,"War of the Human Tanks is a story driven strategy game with a gameplay reminiscent of Battleship and Chess, featuring a story of war, loyalty, sacrifice and human shaped tanks. This story takes place in a land vaguely reminiscent of modern-day Japan. In the twenty years since the first Human Tank was developed, the war raging between the Empire of Japon and the Kingdom of Japon has turned into a proxy war fought between Human Tanks on both sides. The Empire of Japon once ruled the entire land of Japon. Now diminished and cornered, the Empire prepares to make its last stand as the tanks of the Kingdom of Japon draw close to its capital. Shoutaro Daihon'ei, Lieutenant of the Imperial Army moves out to the battlefield, followed closely by the loyal Human Tanks in his company.

It's a gentle reminder that sometimes we should stop worrying about our destination and just enjoy the journey. Steer a boat down a river and avoid obstacles and debris Explore beautiful hand crafted sceneries Enjoy wonderful soundtrack composed by Jozef Sarissky COMMENT FROM DEVELOPER: I developed this game alone during a course of 3-4 months. Whole project started when I was experimenting with environment design and it has slowly transformed into this short metaphorcial journey which I decided to share with you. Working on this project was a very interesting and rewarding experience that has taught me a lot and pushed my limits. I understand that this game is quite unusual and it may not fit everyone's style but hopefuly there are some of you who will enjoy this journey and find themselves in it.

She just said 'James.'' Sagebrush is a short-form first-person narrative adventure about exploring the compound of an apocalyptic Millenialist cult in remote New Mexico years after they collectively took their lives in a mass suicide event. In Sagebrush , you'll investigate the long-abandoned Black Sage Ranch, the former home of Perfect Heaven, an apocalyptic cult formed in the early 1990s under the guiding hand of the prophet Father James. Inspired by Real-World Apocalyptic Cults Based on extensive research into cult groups both famous and obscure, large and small, Sagebrush avoids simplistic motivations and easy answers. The members of the Flock are diverse and complex people with varied needs, hopes, and fears. An Immersive, Lo-Fi 3D World Sagebrush features an evocative low-poly, low-resolution, less-is-more art style that combines retro aesthetics with modern technology, along with a fully-realized soundscape and an original ambient musical score that immerses you in the remote New Mexico desert. A Whole Compound to Explore Black Sage Ranch is yours to wander, from the trailers that housed the cultists, to the halls where they gathered for food and prayer, to the old mines that stretch out below the compound, untouched for nearly a century. Uncover the Real Story Find notes, recordings, and belongings that give insight into the people who lived at Black Sage Ranch. What did they believe? Why did they join? Were they happy? And why did they choose to end it all?

The game throws lots of things at you to try to distract you: -Paint covers your screen as you mess up, so you have to wipe it off. -The narrator telling you nonsense stories and jokes all while you try to keep focus and pay attention. -Monitors turning off, forcing you to turn them back on. -Alarm clocks turning on, annoying you until you turn them off.

414,"Ted by Dawn is a humor laden throwback to classic action platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid. The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. There are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success. On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.","“Step aside Dead Rising, for Ted By Dawn is the new zombie flick in town. It combines side-scrolling platform style movement with undead slaying action, and it’s hilarious. Basically, you’ve got to fight the undead, while dodging giant razor baldes and/or fire and work your way towards bosses. It sounds unplayable, I know, but you’ll be relieved to hear that you are given a chainsaw, and a motorcycle at points. I can imagine those bits aren’t so hard.

422,"What is Math Classroom Challenge? Math Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In the game the player never loses. There is simply a parameterizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much. Math Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.","“Math Classroom Challenge is a excellent (iOS) app for learning basic Math skills (i.e. additions, subtraction, etc.).” Apps Gadget “Math Street Challenge, the augmented version of Math Classroom Challenge” Arbrettspiele",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/header.jpg?t=1621066677,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dc61bb8254149c4b3a93948018d4d016cc9ed234.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bedf34ae3608b35f65e2f41e1e658b9694a7252b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dfdabd155bb40b7843e2ce2de12eddedfb7f2dcd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_cdc7b2a032590480dca5375b8632e676fa2b8fec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6c9a04ffec68682ad3c5733530e7193de33a7412.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bb7c433f20432b5cffe78e7742bf348af72a65c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_070f3c83c3531131781fb8208a179db3dd64a490.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_e355a1755711b64df1a4aa734e2f50ee19837774.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_366170220ffbf8f42110bb33c9ae205f44571680.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6e2d26827ad6aeecc8831833b1f723d70b68639b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_71c973c3a9e52ce8ed02bc9b16987467acf56979.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_f965ece43d8cea8fb9e012e1ee63e70e73112631.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_33ff08bfa379b2a1dcf451d461d90512290b0cbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_15029f5d78fc6619ae1eef55012e63a267aa554c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_9e052ffb0510615a5f00452ab6874175e0558eb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_94baa09916a4c6dd57c730d3efceb1d6f0f84fed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_04072a18613c3bdc17f00b9172bcc0edd77011b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677","Casual,Indie"

447,"Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is an epic - and humorous - fantasy adventure and role-playing game in which you take on the role of Shawn O'Conner, a young man striving to become a hero as well as a rogue. Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is the work of Lori Ann Cole and Corey Cole, creators of Quest for Glory, Shannara, Castle of Dr. Brain, and Mixed-Up Fairy Tales. Although Hero-U is not a direct sequel to the Quest for Glory games, it features the same mix of adventure, role-playing, humor, and immersive storytelling that we introduced in that series. Shawn can become the Rogue of the Year while exploring a mysterious castle, making friends and enemies, fighting deadly foes, and uncovering the secrets of his own hidden past. Meanwhile players will enjoy the rich and humorous dialogue and descriptions as they guide Shawn through his adventures. During the day, Shawn attends classes at the University, practices his skills, and tries to make friends with other students. At night, it's time to pull out weapons, armor, and traps to explore the abandoned wine cellars, stunning sea caves, creepy catacombs, and deadly dungeon beneath Hero-U. Most combat is optional for those who prefer a pure adventure game, but there are ample rewards for those who choose to valorously fight the creatures that threaten the school and all of Sardonia.","“The founding family of Quest for Glory has returned with an all-new unofficial entry that proves worthy of its predecessors’ legacy yet still manages to distinguish itself entirely on its own.” 80 – Adventure Gamers “Lives up to the Quest for Glory legacy.

Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel. And it cannot possibly go wrong. In theory. Seconds into its maiden voyage it crashes into hyperspace, vanishes... and collides with your house. Bewildered, you find your way aboard, and just as you are gazing at its awe-inspiring interior, the ship takes off again and heads deep into space. You are stranded. But you are not alone... The ship is inhabited by a crew of malfunctioning robots and a semi-deranged parrot. You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters-Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortilian Bantoburn O'Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot. Talk to them, interrogate them. Give them orders. They will listen to you, answer you and, if they happen to feel like it, obey you. Sometimes. To begin with you are a third-class passenger, and you quickly find yourself in the grip of one of the most powerful forces known to man-the desire for a free upgrade. As you move up to second and, at last, to first class, more and more of the ship becomes accessible to you, and more and more of its mysteries are revealed. What has happened here? What terrible events occurred the night before the launch? Who is the mysterious Titania whose brooding statues dominate the ship? Can you solve a series of increasingly bizarre and surreal puzzles., unlock the central mystery and return to Earth before the parrot drives you finally and irrevocably mad?

468,"Betrayer is a first person action adventure game that takes you to the New World at the turn of the 17th century. The year is 1604. You sailed from England expecting to join a struggling colony on the coast of Virginia. Instead, you find only ghosts and mysteries. What catastrophe blighted the land and drained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes who lived here? Clue by clue, you must piece together the story of what befell this doomed settlement and find a way to set things right. You will be hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows as you explore an expansive wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and search for survivors. Key Features Explore large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery. Chart your own course in search of clues and treasures. Switch between two distinct worlds featuring different enemies, obstacles, and threats. Wield early 17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and tomahawks. Upgrade your arsenal by purchasing or finding faster, deadlier, longer-ranged weapons. Charge headlong into battle with guns blazing or pick enemies off quietly. A novel, movement-based stealth system lets you hide in plain sight or use the wind to mask your footsteps. Equip ability-enhancing Charms to complement your play style, granting anything from extra health to faster movement to improved stealth. Play with the default visual style for maximum eeriness and tension or customize the color and contrast settings to suit your tastes.

519,"Stephanie 'Watts' Watson, an aspiring bassist, bounced from audition to audition never finding music that really resonated with her, that is, until she discovered the magic of funk. Caught up in the groove, she recruits a group of hometown amateurs to take on art school darlings La Tormenta at the Battle of the Bands. Time-based sokoban-style puzzles Character-driven story set in 1990s suburban America Strategy-esque squad resources and rewindable turns to optimize your solutions Sequenced combo moves and 40 levels of strategic madness Join Watts as she grows on a musical journey rooted in funk and fusion. Soulful grooves and hot licks are composed by Pete Fraser, session saxophonist to the The Pogues, Friendly Fires, and Field Music! Twenty musical motifs are recorded by a live ensemble of seven funk masters, providing the foundation for the dynamic music in the game. Unique songs are generated depending on what directions and paths you take in each puzzle. Customize your performance with alternate playing styles, instruments swaps, and realtime audio effect pedals. Each character in your band moves through the sokoban puzzle maps in different ways, encountering unique solutions and obstacles. Advancing a character consumes a turn and part of the timeline, setting up interactions with other characters and enemies at different points in time. Rewinding a turn undoes your move, allowing you to find improved solutions and new ways to tackle problems. Manipulate each character separately, rewinding or fast-forwarding along the timeline in the process to reach her current point in time. Changes in time are reflected in the progress and actions both past and present of each character, creating some possibilities and removing others. Each character has his own resource-limited super move which can be triggered under certain conditions. Tip toe through tight spaces with your bassist, slide through guards with your keytar player, break through walls with your drummer, or blow enemies out of the way with your mighty super sax. Strategic use of your super moves increase the number of solutions to each puzzle and are the key in gaining a maximum score. Four resource-based musical metrics govern how and when you can move and interact with objects in the levels. These can completely block progress if used inefficiently, and create amazing musical chains and high scores when regulated artfully. Backbeat is a homage to the 16 and 32-bit story-driven games of the 1990s, recreating the challenges and victories of the last days of analog life and the birth of the internet. The suburban Washington D.C. area is reflected in diner parking lots, shopping malls, and dimly lit arcades. A colorful cast of supporting characters both friend and foe join Watts as she struggles with leadership, success, and holding together a band.","“There's no doubt from this brief, unfinished snippet of the game there's something thoroughly pleasant about Backbeat” Mid-production build preview – Wireframe Magazine Issue 57 “From what we've played so far, Backbeat has the swagger that could yet elevate it to indie stardom.” Mid-production build preview – EDGE Magazine Issue 365",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/header.jpg?t=1678918577,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_f1f384d420232f1091b9ab0847876fff9460ffe3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_bcf95d12652493eaf49c1666a0ff33f68232cb42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_7d54957928a3cea2b7e8777e8a723e81b9b59b13.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_dfb8f7b8a1e47e7f0be3ea57ca57154b3b775c67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_51c6130493532601d39bda19f7dfe770b0e3be14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_b53f96659d5204219732a2a9793d397b5cc46e6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1585730/ss_e61294030330d883b419b464d7220a7f5b9392a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1678918577","Indie,Strategy"

557,"Build a loyal band of followers and survive the journey across a broken world. Barely. Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? These features make Nowhere Prophet stand out Card-based tactical combat system New procedurally generated maps each game Find loot and recruit followers to build your deck Unlock new content across multiple playthroughs More than 300 cards for you to discover Indian infused electronica soundtrack A roguelike deck-building game Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

640,"Sym is a puzzle-platformer that explores social anxiety disorder. Play as Josh, a teenage boy trying to reconcile a maze of two contrasting worlds that coexist within the blank spaces of each other - his perception of reality, and the world he created to avoid his fears. Josh exists in these worlds as alter egos, Caleb and Ammiel. Caleb lives only in the white world, on the fringe of reality. He wants to overcome his fears. Ammiel resides in the darkness; he wants only to be alone and completely detached from human contact. Take control of these egos and flip between both realms to solve problems and traverse obstacles. Learn to utilize both distinct spaces, to avoid obstacles and find a path to safety. Explore 44 challenging levels of logic puzzles, platforming and mazes. Switch between worlds of light and darkness to overcome obstacles and find the way forward. Create and share new levels easily with the level editor.

When he tries to find a job there, he stumbles upon a mysterious challenge with a potentially priceless reward, and several other alchemists vying for the prize. With a monster plaguing the town, he must use all the alchemical skills at his disposal to prove that fire can truly survive in this world of endless ice. But what is the monster, and why is it here? The truth may be more related to Dougal himself than he believes... Novel-length story A whimsical yet complex story with over 100,000 words of alchemy, mystery, romance and deceit.

Boost is an intense arcade action-sports game that will leave you joyously gasping for breath! With a focus on active play, a few rounds of Boost is sure to wake you up and get your blood pumping! Teleoperate your Luma-Jock in the 3rd Galactic Quadrant's finest arena. Use your Luma-shield to Thwonk the Booster Orb and keep the rally going as long as possible. Every four returns you'll achieve a Boost and the orb will increase its speed. Keep it up for long and you'll be rallying with your opponent at near relativistic velocities! Watch out for Mines as you leap and dive for survival. Mines have a reverse photon charge and will destroy your Luma-shield and the Orb on contact. Not to worry! Your Tele-gloves have a positive charge and you can use them to bat Mines out of the way. However, be warned that Mines will accumulate with every Boost and you'll need to keep their numbers low if you want to prevail.

Use buildings and terrain to your advantage, or deny them to the enemy. 2-8 Player Multiplayer Competition via LAN or Internet - Go online with friends and join the ultimate battle of Axis versus Allies.","“It's beautiful, though that's entirely the wrong word. This is a war game, so the word should be 'visceral' or something. Models are hugely detailed for an RTS, physics implemented impressively and so on. But relevantly, it's a functional sort of beauty (or - er - viscerality).” 10/10 – Eurogamer “Company of Heroes should be on the must-play list of every RTS fanatic out there, even those tired of WWII settings. It's just that good.” 9.6/10 – PC Gamer “The transformation from a idyllic little town into a heap of crushed buildings and burned out husks of vehicles can be shocking. Seeing and hearing major explosions that cause bodies (and bits of bodies) to fly across the screen along with rubble from a nearby building simply puts you more into the battle than any RTS in memory.” 9.4/10 – IGN",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/header.jpg?t=1632304482,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a02fbfb9a63def39ad5dce6f52435820a3338242.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_07254123cc0b22872f31ee55eb3f0d8f004a7c85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a965a0017ad2d2eb8b048c479e2425550191d2dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_535b5736857c63e4a7a786b90a03e30a07f8220e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_290136d7dba4eaf7c15f7cc2c58e6f1b52bc0072.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_4069148ca5c574d40ba4f3ac323c51a6ce040ea6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_02cf401290f1a8faf7fc15ba44aac553359d9cc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482","Action,Strategy"

804,"Guide one of 12 races on their first interstellar journey from a single planet, until it becomes a mighty pan-galactic empire. From the Star Map you must manage your empire, deploy your fleets and conduct research, diplomacy and trade. Plot your strategy. Explore the universe and found new colonies.

Make pacts and alliances, make threats or ask for favours - and when the time is right, continue diplomacy by 'other means' and fight it out in a real-time 3D system that brings to life the beauty and visceral carnage of space combat. All with one purpose: to emerge victorious and conquer the galaxy. Although complex and deep, with possibly endless strategies, powerful help and advisor features help you get up to speed quickly. Unlike many games in this genre, Armada 2526 focuses on providing a game that can be finished in a reasonable time, and emphasizes battle and strategy over economic micromanagement.

Customizable map size and number of players, allowing you to construct tight 2 player confrontations, or huge galaxies with 50 or more players, and thousands of stars. Map designer included. Twelve animated alien races to play and battle against. Full featured diplomacy system, with a highly intelligent AI and options to ask favors, make demands, and issue ultimatums. More than 100 technology items to research, including advances in ship construction, ground defenses, biological warfare, and psychic powers. 3D Real-time battle system for fighting huge battles with 100 or more ships per side. Ground combat is integrated into the combat system, allowing marines to be landed to battle ground defenses while ship combat rages overhead. More than a hundred beautifully crafted ship models, including mighty dreadnaughts, long range missile cruisers, fighters, carriers, and asteroids for bombarding planets. Tough A.I. opponents.","“For a 4X strategy title it hits a lot of the sweet spots you want and is a great entry for anyone who wants to give running a star spanning empire a whirl.” 75 – Strategy Informer “Armada 2526 is a very solid game, it is well designed and provides a good gaming experience to the player.” 80 – Space Sector “Varied alien races with different needs and requests means each play through will require different strategies, giving the game a great amount of replay value.” 70 – Game Zone",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/header.jpg?t=1578329890,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_9b65d8f411af113b51b0d4647959b8ada5659796.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_99bbf5392637f50bd4e2cb8a79769d832425c2a3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_b110419ecf80681ccf60287b516a16cab74df582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_86246e35a3e57c0c41ca9c7489eda5a531b346ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_5d1d962c53a96b302413a220cc21985b18fc61ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_336607a94871da4f411db7a2012658554ce5f3b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_12c59ed352317ef8311f5e65b6318c6ea9ef1943.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_c94be3fde7f0ddda341c2643fc91b54b78ca95fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_71573c1884b67631d02726b051f228a9db8861fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_9b157df1234428784638b20ef3a024fdcfc60759.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/46790/ss_ad69d7b3059cdb57b353484416791aacdf9372ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578329890",Strategy

1007,"A young man awakens in a forest, deep in the Hinodean wilds. He doesn't remember how he got there, or where he needs to be. Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way... Customize your heroes the way you want. The game contains 54 weapons, 150 different types of armor and accessories, and 92 unique skills and spells for the heroes to learn. Additionally, there are 54 gems to equip, which enhance the heroes' skills in different ways. The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time! There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will help or hinder you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed during the fight. Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends. No grinding. The game is a linear adventure focusing on battles, visual novel segments, and visiting merchants to resupply. Difficulty can be changed at any time, even during dialogue. Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting. Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, and can damage an enemy's armour. The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, coming to terms with the world's true nature, and the concept of trust. Characters Aedric Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know. In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well. Rhea A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him. Although immature at times, and quick to anger, Rhea is loyal to those she loves, and will often put herself in danger, without a second thought. In battle, Rhea fights with her fists, delivering quick strikes, which allow her to build stamina quickly. Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act more often than her friends. Athena Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes. She is burdened by the guilt of her past, and is incredibly consumed with how the world, and her Goddess, perceives her.

1046,"Robot rebellions should be quelled by the best of the best. When the best of the best are killed... it's up to you. Subdue the uprising in time, or your corporate overlords nuke the city. Bionic Dues is a tactical, turn-based roguelite with mech customization. Guide multiple classes of Exos through a variety of missions filled with enemy robots that are as buggy as they are angry. This is at least as bad as it sounds. Explore for loot, destroy key robotic facilities, and brace yourself for the final attack by your enemies... just as soon as they can pull it together. Features Out-think wide-ranging tactical situations featuring robots with bad GPS, terrible aim, insecurity, a lack of focus, a tendency to backstab, and dozens of other maladies to exploit. Over 40 unique bots, ranging from the hilariously inept-but-dangerous DumBots, BlunderBots, and BatBots to the terrifyingly effective WyvernBots, DoomBots, and MurderBots. Carve your own path: choose 30 to 50 missions out of the 120 you discover as you explore the city map. Which missions you choose determines how prepared you will be for the final battle against the massing robot army. Missions come in 23 different general flavors, and are entirely procedurally-generated like a floor of a traditional roguelite. Mix and match your squad of four from six classes of Exos: Assault, Siege, Science, Sniper, Ninja and Brawler. Each has its own build and weaponry. Choose an overall pilot from a roster of six to add a powerful perk that lasts your entire campaign. Customize your four Exos with procedurally-generated loot that grants weaponry and defensive upgrades, new abilities, and more. Difficulty levels ranging from quite casual to incredibly hardcore. Save and reload your game with ease any time, or tough it out in ironman mode. Stellar soundtrack by composer Pablo Vega, headlined by the game's title theme 'The Home We Once Knew.'","“What's wonderful about Bionic Dues is that it manages to combine meta-strategy and micro-strategy... It's like a fast-paced, mini-XCOM.” Andrew Groen, The Penny Arcade Report “Top game moment: Realising a momentary oversight has condemned you to almost certain doom, but then, with only a perfect set of well-thought long-contemplated moves, you pull everything out the bag, blow the rig, and get the hell out of dodge to receive a hard-earned mission successful.” 8.5/10 – Richard Nolan, Strategy Informer “Bionic Dues delivers tough decisions, sweeping tactics and enormous mech battles; packing massive replayability and unpredictability into its budget price point.

1079,"Heartbound is a non-traditional role-playing game about a boy, his dog, secrets, and sanity. Follow Lore and Baron on their adventures through time and space. Handle combat through a series of unique mini-games with varying objectives. Change the story through exploration and interaction with the world. A massive series of optional cryptographic puzzles that can be solved as a community. Varying environments with unique pixel art, an inspired soundtrack, and tons of extra socks. That awful feeling when you do something terrible to someone who loves you. More gags than you can shake a stick at. Binder can lend you one of his if you don't bring your own. Advanced sadness. Heartbound does not use the traditional systems of Levels, Experience, or Consumables. Everything is skill-based and combat can change based on your relationships with others or things you have done. Weapons can be found throughout the world and they augment how much damage you deal in certain situations. Every enemy you encounter has unique mini-games that you will not see anywhere else in the game. There are no random battles and a number of encounters are avoidable based on how you progress. Combat never ends in death and defeating someone allows you to see their memories from their perspective. What you do from there is up to you.","“Returning to a game in this style felt like coming home.” IGN “It appears that Heartbound will be a game that'll tug at the heartstrings and more by the time of its release, which, judging by the title, seems just right.” Game Skinny “I really really like it!

Captain Miaou can now wear an Antigravity Belt and this changes everything! This tool allows a better control over your trajectories, with the ability to reduce the cat's speed and gravity at will, at free cost. Massive game lifespan, covering 5 moons packed with huge levels and many secrets to uncover! Key Features Sense of exploration - The wonder of discovery keeps growing, with hidden items and shortcuts lurking around nooks and corners that are scattered in huge diversified levels. Who knows what you'll encounter next? You'll be kept on your toes, waiting to release gas or attack at the proper time. An epic journey - Miaou Moon is also a survival game where you have a limited amount of energy available for your moves. You constantly need to refuel by eating scattered food. The gameplay adds layers of depth: lose all energy and you'll die, eat too much and you'll die! To this, add the fact that your size changes based on your energy level, which allows you to shrink into narrow paths or grow stronger and deal more damage. Multiple goals to achieve - There are so many ways to feel rewarded even after completing levels: try beating the highest scores online, find enough hidden energy cells to reach the next moon, collect tools to unlock new cool catsuit powers, and more! With tons of levels and five moons that challenge your gameplay with different physical proprieties, you're up for a long run for survival.

During World War II, the Russians deported by trains several hundred thousand people from Eastern Europe, including Poland to Siberia for work camps. You play as one of the displaced people. Our task is to escape from the train and survive in the Siberian taiga in Virtual Reality.","“I could hear men’s voices, and when I took a look around, I realized that I was inside the cattle wagon. Around the walls of the carriage were people in worn clothes. Through the half-open door, a blizzard raged outside. An inner voice spoke: “Maybe if the train slowed down, I would be able to escape.” I jumped out, landed in a snowdrift, and suddenly I was again in Jozwiak-Rodan’s cozy apartment. “I think history should be told in a way that young people can understand it,” he said as I put the virtual reality goggles and controllers on the desk. And so, he and his programmer friend Jacek Ross started developing the VR game Siberian Run in 2018. Immersed in a virtual Siberia, players take on the role of a fugitive trying to avoid capture. They can collect different objects that help on the quest and interact with the world around them. The shouts of guards calling out from somewhere in the snowstorm reminds players that time is running out—and that each mistake can cost you your life.

But we wouldn't want you to get bored while you're here, so how about some puzzles to solve while the sun sets? In each level of Puzzle Island VR you're given various objects such as crates, buckets, balls or planks. Equipped with some of the most realistic ropes you've ever seen in a game, you'll need to somehow stack those objects to touch the glowing orb. Sounds easy, right? Well it isn't always. Sometimes the wind will blow your boxes away or the force-field prevents you putting that create exactly where you need it and often the solution is more challenging than simply stacking objects. The puzzles will require you to think like an engineer, keep cool like a martial arts grand-master, have a steady hand like a marksman and also think outside of the box like an inventor.

1435,"Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments. Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator. The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.","“'Immersion” means different things to different players. Turn-based and RTS players identify so much with their units that they feel they are members of the force. Simulation and FPS players have even more visceral connections: they are virtually on the spot, spewing bullets and doing Split-Ss. Submarine simulations tend to combine both styles. The main position is the captain’s positions in the command center where he can pick targets by the periscope. He can also click on dials to control speed, course and depth. Some simulations can send players to specific compartments like engineering, fire control, sonar/radar, radio, even crew quarters via clicks on icons. Still, the player is in control with no real change in perspective. Skvader Studios’ – aided by Subsim.com -- Wolfpack gives a whole new dimension to submarine sims.” Wargamer “If you've ever dreamed of working on a 'highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War', Wolfpack is the game for you.” PC Gamer “'It was our second mission, so our three-man crew was a little nervous. Even though my two gaming buddies and I cracked jokes about our rather limited adventures at sea we knew that we were playing a game that was deadly serious. We were tasked with seeking out and destroying any British supply convoys that we came across in the frigid waters of the North Sea. Wolfpack is not an easy game. It sure managed to flummox my two gaming buddies and I when we initially tried it out. This is not a submarine simulator where many of the complex calculations and controls are streamlined for you. No, this is a full-on simulator which forces you to come to grips with your chosen U-boats many machinations all by yourselves.

YOLTRUND Yoltrund: The World of Eternal Woe , a short story written in 2014 by Michael Cox, now takes flesh as Yoltrund . Using unique lore and characters, this tale is told. Long before, there were Two, two brothers of The Ones Who Came Before; one of Light, one of Shadow. These brothers collided to form a third; one of Flame. The One King, burning with anger and hatred, created the Void that lives in all things; the barrier between realms to prevent his elder brothers from fighting further. He then succumbed to Sin, causing his eternal fires to rage onward in beautiful shadow. In doing so, he created his realm of Yoltrund, where he punishes such sinners with purifying flame. He then vanished, never to be seen again. YOLTRUND, THE GAME Experience the gripping tale as you play as a lost soul, trapped within Yoltrund, and must find his way out of the realm of eternal fire. However, to do so, he must travel deeper into this dark world and must survive the mazes within to prevent himself from being corrupted beyond saving. FEATURES Unique and incredibly deep story and characters based on almost a decade's worth of lore from the unique Kaiyumian lore base. And with seeds planted in Yoltrund for future instances, your mind will race to solve the mysteries of Yoltrund for them to be revealed in time!

The king's greed knew no bounds and set out to bankrupt his people by taxing their hard earned acorns. With no acorns to any of the peasant's names they grew angrier and angrier as each day passed. On one cold dark evening, the King had sent his loyal tax man to collect the acorns from Charles DeMontequirrel who had refused to pay the unjust nut tax. As the tax man knocked on Charles' wooden door it swung wide open. Charles stood before the tax collector visibly upset as he was scolded for not following the king's unfair decrees. Charles could no longer simply refuse to pay up and wanted only to set things right. He snatched the legal document the collector shoved in his face and tore it to pieces. A call to arms was made and a skirmish set outside of Charles' house as he began his battle with the tax man and set forth on his rodent revolution upon the king and his men.

1590,"Just Ski is a challenging, minimalist, physics driven game that will frustrate and punish you in the beginning but reward you with the feeling of mastery in the end. The Controls The controls for Just Ski are borrowed from an old, abandoned game called Ski Stunt Simulator. Your only control over the skier is to move your mouse down to make him crouch or up to make him extend. It's a very simple to understand mechanic but requires a healthy amount of practice to master. The key to success with Just Ski is learning to control your rotation while in the air. It's all about gaining a feel for the conservation of angular momentum: crouch to spin faster, extend to spin slower. Your Goal Just ski to the cabin.

1662,"Please Knock on My Door is a story-driven game which gives you control over a person suffering from depression and social anxiety. Help them get through work and reach out to friends while desperately trying to survive. Experience the frailty these themes bring and gain a better understanding of what it's like to live with some of the most common mental health issues today. A compelling and emotional story offering a voice to those who have none. A fully voiced narrator who always has your best in mind. Probably. A gameplay system which adds to the weight of every story-choice you make. No 'Game Over' screen, only alternate endings that tie into your choices. A soundtrack that has been tailor-made for this experience. Relationships that can be developed or broken. Game length varies depending on your choices, ranging from 1-3 hours with enough content that you can come back and explore different parts of the narrative in consequent playthroughs. As in real life, all of your choices are immediately saved. There is only one save. Please Knock on My Door has been in development since autumn 2014 and was initially supposed to be a 6 month exploration of my own experiences with depression. A word of caution; this is a game that might be difficult to play for those who have dealt with psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. That said, I truly believe that through entertainment we are able to understand topics that would otherwise be too foreign for us. I hope this game can help you better understand what it can be like to live with these issues, like it has already helped me.","“Please Knock on My Door gave me a better understanding of myself and my illness, a remarkable achievement for a video game.” Recommended – Eurogamer “'Please Knock on My Door' undeniably cements itself as an indie gem bent on changing the way in which narratives are delivered to the player, making the experience of interacting with a game a highly personal matter.” 4.5/5.0 – The Daily Californian “It is, by far, the best and worst gaming experience I have ever had, and there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that it deserves a score I have never used before.” 10/10 – Gamereactor",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/header.jpg?t=1567704497,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_787d2eec52e6baf7517183d451dc5b4c6b71d0ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_bac8664e20b57e720a9c40499a732534e64b6f92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_8562b0682043154f5762c8e75ad918f41b137481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_d48917c209a2824089d167ad229d40a9dcfbd611.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_a1e5ba32846de86230e22b67bc75a9a26d0f7298.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/613450/ss_e260fcf3239fa386c6afde3ee3c4baf428af57bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1567704497",Indie

1682,"Something Ate My Alien is a 2D, digging and puzzle platformer game where you take the role of the AI Antalasia, and control your little Alien blobs to explore the planets you visit! Your task is to dig through the ground of the different worlds and find all the items required by the pirate that is hijacking you. During the adventure on each planet you have to battle environmental dangers, fight off wildlife, solve secret puzzle chambers, and all this while surviving on a depleting oxygen supply and a threat far scarier than the local wildlife. Key Features Dig through the depths of 4 different planets and collect as much loot as possible. Solve puzzle chambers by pushing and pulling blocks to reveal secret treasures. Survive by finding oxygen recharge stations and dodging environmental obstacles. Fight the hostile flora and fauna with your choice of 6 specialized weapons. Upgrade and build your equipment by collecting items and energy. Find hidden relics and collect achievements. Engage in bigger battles with the scary huge threats guarding the hidden secrets. DIG Guide the Aliens to find all the resources the pirate demands, and any additional items you find you can use to build upgrades. Some planets are rich in gems, others in specific minerals, fossils, artefacts or gases. Collect as much as you can! SOLVE PUZZLES Each planet has an array of puzzle chambers that once solved reveals hidden treasures. Pull and push the blocks into the correct positions to get the tokens containing parts of the code you need to unlock new places and move your adventure forward. SURVIVE Your Aliens need to survive in the perilous environments while digging and exploring. Find oxygen recharge stations and beware of pools of corrosive, super heated or poisonous substances, falling rocks, slippery ice, toxic gases and open flames. FIGHT There are 6 unique weapons all with different mechanics to defend yourself against the abundant flora and fauna. Look out for charging animals, flying creatures, armoured beasts and be careful walking underneath hanging fungi. UPGRADE Use the items the pirate doesn't want to build new upgrades for the Aliens. What should you pick? Faster mining? Better guns? Bigger oxygen tanks? Longer lasting jet packs? Or perhaps something else to aid your Aliens while exploring the caves? THE BIGGER THREAT The same alien race that left behind a maze of locked teleporters and the hidden codes to unlock them also left behind something very dangerous to guard it all, a fail safe.

1772,"THE DRAGON'S LEGACY The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this 'being?' deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr. GAMEPLAY You, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself. That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight. Through 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay. You will also fall under the spell of 'The I of the Dragon' with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring. FEATURES A choice of three dragons each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon. There are no limits to the possibilities 12 unique territories representing various geographical areas: mountains desserts, forests and savanna etc. Each map has over 10 square kilometers to cover More than 60 spells with special effects available to each dragon Real time Terra-Forming allows complete mountain ranges disappear and reappear in another location Static and real-time lighting ensure the correct lighting conditions to every day and night cycle Fascinating sunsets and a night sky full of stars await you The Time Control-Option makes it possible to adjust 'The I of The Dragon' to your own speed Slow motion mode with a fascinating effect","“Very good!

1815,"The cameras are all focused on you; the center of the scene. Not just in character, you are the character. The part to play is singularly yours. Written just for you. You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words. Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play. Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.

In most other shooters in this genre, you only have to look out for yourself. Well that's too easy we say. In P-3 Biotic, if the Nucleus dies, then it's game over. You'll find yourself switching from frantic defence to all out attack as you fight a desperate battle to keep the Nucleus alive. It doesn't help that you can use the energy stored in the Nucleus to over-power your weapons, turn your ship into a projectile, or release a devastating AOE shockwave, tempting you to walk a fine line between success and failure.

1859,"An afternoon spent walking between the gravestones reading the whispers of those that have passed. This is the experience Boon Hill promises to give. A graveyard simulator, with all the adventure of exploring a real graveyard without looking like a creeper. To put it as simply as possible, Boon Hill is a game about reading gravestones. There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again. Free Roaming The game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines. No Danger The game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you. Though they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard. Discover Mystery In the Graveyard Boon Hill is not aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations. The threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone. The specifics of what you can expect from Boon Hill: Fancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago. The ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive. Well over a thousand individual graves and epitaphs! It's the whole point of the game, after all. Several NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Crows! The graveyard has a lot of crows. It's as much a feature as anything else. Figure out what's up with that weird goth chick!
