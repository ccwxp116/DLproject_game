A graveyard simulator , with all the adventure of exploring a real graveyard without looking like a creeper . To put it as simply as possible , Boon Hill is a game about reading gravestones . There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard , reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again .

Create your hero , gather your team , and save the world in this exciting new turn - based strategy ! Build your Team - select from the many available heroes and unlock more throughout Full story campaign - writers and creators from Sentinel Comics Freeform movement - Turn Based game that allows you to move anywhere Squad dynamics - heroes or villains can work together for more powerful actions Living Environments - multiple objectives , interactions and dangers Create your Hero - choose backstory , archetype , powers , and appearance What kind of hero will you be ? Custom Heroes Choose the character ' s backstory , personality , power source , abilities and costume . Heroes have ' stances ' that provide boosts to certain stats like extra movement along with powerful sets of abilities and can be fully customized to fit your play style . Build your hero from 1 2 exciting themes - fill your stances with powerful abilities from any three : Power Melee - When you really want to hit someone really hard . Combos - Concentrate your attacks , spread ' em out , or bring a friend ! Supportive - Whether protecting or attacking , the right move requires no planning . Blaster - Attack as many as you can in several different areas ! Interceptor - Never let an enemy out of your sights and punish wrong moves . Minions - Disposable and endless , have your own minions fight for you ! Gadgets - Deploy an arsenal of gadgets that eliminate all who oppose you . And more ! Creating a superhero identity is more than a costume selection ! Choose how your hero uses their abilities , different weapons , attack styles , and special effects; some themes even have different types of units that you can summon . Refine your heroic identity throughout the game - changing everything about how your hero looks , all the way down to your hero ' s body type , between any mission . Sync and Vigilance Actions Sync and Vigilance actions add life to the battlefield when characters perform additional actions out of sequence , triggered by special conditions . When a character performs an action , sync actions allow other characters to take part or enhance that action , like a character creating a distraction to remove the target ' s Evade defense before an attack lands . Positioning your team to take advantage of these extra actions can be critical to the success of a mission . Vigilance allows an inactive character to react to the active character based on various triggers , such as moving through their line of sight . Each character has a ' vigilance zone ' around them which sets the chance of the vigilance action happening . These actions can go much further than the standard overwatch with actions like ' keep cover ' which allows a character to try and find new cover when flanked . Large Scale Missions Players will embark on several missions throughout the campaign . These missions are broken up into groups of engagements - each offering unique objectives , enemy types and player choice on where to go next - keeping each feeling fresh and unique . Another benefit to these smaller engagements is that the player will not be overwhelmed by both the quantity of enemies and time for each turn . However , stringing all these engagements together still allows the player to feel like their heroes are very powerful as they dispatch lots of enemies throughout the mission . Initiative Will you be able to rescue the hostages in time ? Can you survive the chaos until more defensive actions are taken ? Initiative can have a major impact in situations like these . In Sentinels of Freedom , initiative determines the turn order for all characters and events in a round . Actions from previous rounds can have a major impact on initiative . A Swap mechanic allows hero to shift their position in the initiative order allowing more control over which hero to activate . The first hero in the initiative order receives a speed bonus while the last hero is awarded an accuracy bonus .","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy"

You take charge of the surviving crew of the USS Salem , a U . S . Navy submarine that sinks while on a top secret research mission during the early years of the Cold War . They find themselves surrounded by the ruins of a forgotten civilization , their vessel too badly damaged to escape the seabed . In Story Mode , you slowly unravel the mysteries of the depths in a desperate quest to rescue your missing crewmembers and fix the crippled Salem . The choices you make determine the fate of your crew - and the entire world . Every expedition lives or dies by the strength of its crew . You have a diverse array of character traits and skills at your disposal , each opening exciting new options in both combat and in story events . As you delve ever deeper , you may also subject your crew to powerful but grisly mutations; the price of survival is high , and no one escapes the abyss unchanged . The horror and the void which hide in deep waters can become too much to bear , and your crew may experience episodes of exhaustion and insanity . Will their psyche get stronger , or will it be forever damaged ? A game of dice with Fate itself will determine the outcome . Salvaged resources can be turned into weapons , armor , or other useful supplies - or they can be used to repair and upgrade the Salem , giving your crew a crucial edge in the fight for survival .

"Redefining Strategy in RTS games . Foresight is an epic space - based RTS game that throws you , the player , into the thick of the battle as a commander . Lead huge fleets , armed with fighters and bombers across wormholes to fight it out with your enemy . Launch bombing missions , fighter patrols , plant observation posts or fire support base with reconnaissance units . Intelligence is key . Recruit capable commanders as your fleet commanders; they ' ll not just obey your orders , they ' ll also talk to you , give you suggestions , raise requests and report on their progress . Fleets are semi - autonomous and therefore have their own command , which is separate from yours though they ' re under your command . This allows you to expand your forces beyond what you can control . They also progress alongside you , gaining experience and improving their abilities . As they get promoted in rank , so does your command; allow you to control more ships . Foresight redefines the strategy component of RTS games by rewarding players for executing correct strategic decisions and not punishing players for a single mis - click or being less dexterous . Build order complexity is minimized to allow players to focus on what matters; building the right thing . Need to arm a capital ship with fighters and bombers ? No problem - simply make a request with that ship . Foresight ' s AI will automate the entire process - between picking the nearest shipyard with the lowest load and deployment to the designated ship . So , what ' s your battle plan ? Blitzkrieg ? Flank attack ? Even in space , such plans are possible because Foresight is built to deliver an reasonably accurate outcome . A large navy may not always win the day . Finally , enjoy the epic battle as fighters dogfight each other , bombers performing bombing runs and ships firing all weapons in their full glory ! Features Foresight supports up to 8 players in single player battles or multiplayer skirmishes . Create fleets with officers who will then talk to you and offer suggestions . Form massive fleets quickly without a complicated build tree . Reasonable automation eliminates the need to overly micro - manage RTS ' chores ' , now you can focus on the battle more . Tide of war can be tilted by intelligence gathering and positioning of ships , as well as having a healthy supply of fighters and bombers . The largest army may not always win .

Build a space station up from bare - bone essentials and a skeleton crew , into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you ' ll probably forget about a few of them .
