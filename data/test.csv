There will be a total of 30 maps in the game, and there are 3 map updates in each period. Go explore as much as you like, collide with the unknown, and learn about the life experience of the Blink Cam.

18,"A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration. Explore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters. There are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened. You will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. The game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.","“If you’re looking for an experience with a unique setting and some very uncommon enemy types, One Little Serf’s debut project will be right up your valley.” GamingPurists",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/header.jpg?t=1583924464,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_c09643df67f116b5a1e99f6152024779bb8c2c1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_0c9623ab4f869387efe8c8ad242625486b79dbd9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_837e2acda17018ba62a45cc4b83f6c52952df05e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_de18bfb7f163c3610d19fef200585a262ddb3922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_e6fb3f65cca04134c3b7935ff40ed3e99fcfe61a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464",RPG

You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel! If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel! From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures! You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force! Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation! Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook. It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain! The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation. Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!","“A Guidebook Of Babel seems to be fanciful and open-minded, but the gameplay is quite mature and the plot is practical and interesting enough. Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, 'Babel' obviously handles both the 'storytelling' and 'puzzle solving' parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then 'A Guidebook Of Babel' is definitely worth watching.” 8.2 – Gamersky “Due to the game's dynamic and fluid design, the surprises of A Guidebook Of Babel will always be endless - every time you think the previous level is foolproof, the next level will immediately break your illusion, telling you that you need to observe carefully, and the story is far less simple than you think. Reverse, reverse and reverse, you can never guess where the story is going, and even if the player has the perspective of God, it will be like being in a mountain, but not seeing the mountain.” 3DM “These things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops. It was also after reading the whole story that I realized that A Guidebook Of Babel is not just a story about a book and a ship, but also a story about the boat maker.” 游研社",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/header.jpg?t=1691389011,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_3f1d7b20597e608191747fd976d7087a8d791a11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_959b248bcbd8774b5ad0097dd1e8bf70af563e0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_9526dcdf81461eb05938951a983c6e969a238d23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5a1d9100408c22aa29d9eaaa9f40aba32cecbd86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5e9e3afec130dc8523b89ec2ef7d6f2745b13e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ed6e7aa76010e68f17e792bcfd98f50f96150c3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_29d12518ad31e00e5a93d1173d0142fb834393f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7faef5ff0d0ea38a04595558cfb38ca35d25f8de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_10f361c2988ce772846f56981d2094f3f81bf96c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7212d5aaf311c52643743a490527794caf969ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_d5bf1c2127b82ca45d1f81dd6ea58fb9d3ebe364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ef320cad58168822bbaec341baae49e587155632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_1f4b4db9b38177f3f6a4b7bbc7ba742f757dba87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_efbe3f7ccf39d48306082c4d212ff285b8dca582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011","Adventure,Indie"

127,"THERE SWINGS A SKULL The town of Pareildas stands in the center of a vast desert. Its citizens live their lives quietly. Or, at least, they once did. In recent days the speaker-gallows sprang, weedlike, in the heart of the town - and since its inception the denizens of Pareildas have been sacrificed, one by one. The electric words that spew from the gallows claim this is to staunch the blistering hatred of the vengeful sun... but the heat has only grown more and more unbearable. OUR PROTAGONISTS Anatoli works for the town train station. He dreams of leaving Pareildas, so that he might peacefully live out the rest of his life with his husband. His dreams share much in common with the blackened husks of the town's denizens that line the streets. Pyotr is an independent artist. He hopes, deeply, that he might do something to stop the hellfire slowly consuming Pareildas. But the price of stopping the natural order is immensely steep - and, of course, there's no guarantee this is a natural occurrence at all... ABOUT THE GAME There Swings a Skull: Grim Tidings is a narrative-horror game built in RPG Maker 2003 by Conor Walsh and Quinn K., with music by Leaf Let. Though the game initially released as a jam game it was so well-received - and sat so well with our team - that we decided to build it out into a full game. Conor Walsh is a professional narrative designer who has written on such titles as The Outer Worlds, A Place, Forbidden, The DreadX Collection 2, and many others. Quinn K. brought indie darling OFF to the English-speaking world and recently released the stylish and moody AN OUTCRY. We hope you enjoy our work. FEATURES A deep central narrative Gorgeous pixel and fullscreen graphics A unique, haunting soundtrack Two separate routes and a third that we dare not mention Multiple endings A hateful sun The endless ocean Death","““THERE SWINGS A SKULL” has found its very own formal language to draw attention to the brutality of the climate catastrophe. Medium and long-term effects such as droughts and heat waves are represented here by a merciless sun that can literally pulverize people. This narrative sledgehammer is countered by the individual characters and their interaction with the world. In a short time, players witness how people stop dreaming, how they project their fears and how their facades crumble in the face of impending doom. All this happens in such a poetic way that it makes you ache.” The Game Curator “All of this surreal oddity and foreboding doom gives There Swings a Skull a very different feel from most horror games.... the town is the monster – a horrifying sun-baked purgatory that has no escape. Madness and death are the only things that flourish there and it looks like you’re headed towards one or the other. Highly recommended.” Alpha Beta Gamer “...the game is... memorably strange, molding together its eccentric ideas with pixel art in sallow colors.” Fanbyte",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/header.jpg?t=1663267807,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_453e2319c5262e04f93e352c3b9c88b99b4f301d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_b7e2f1a21bab620b34bbcf5c0d8ae661de2ffe03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_db1ca49634cd72e2567ace0630f9a2e182042887.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_087b2b6161b19cc3d5e10fccf57f35aa51a4362a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_0d25985caa750e60116cdb29b91d0106e6f13c7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_34560925fd54a10eb5c48508aaa58ec9975934b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_a3bef8e31c8a67b83c638164c8c38fc62af4ddfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_badc87e29265cfc6bff6bb3c76220d586f26827d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_1a9914abe3f323248f7a96c34e8f3d03a74b6115.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1983580/ss_7396c1ff88da811f6c41fec380a70b531a3bba0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1663267807","Casual,Indie"

An expansive world inhabited by quirky, charming and sometimes deadly inhabitants of the afterlife, the Underworld includes Aftervale, a happy hub where the dead come to spend eternity. You are Skully, member of the newly deceased and just when you start to get the hang of being dead, your newfound home and friends are attacked by humans. Instead of seeking gold or other treasure, they kidnap Aftervale's elder skeleton Elzedon and then go after the magic that kindles the spirits of the dead: the Blue Flame. Together with your best bat friend Imber, you have to jump, slash, and flap your way though the Underworld and stop the human threat! Features: Versatile and fluid platform gaming.

335,"Dark Hill Museum of Death is a journey through a virtual museum where uniquely themed exhibits are unlocked by solving puzzles. Never opened to the public, the museum's secrets are yours to discover. Experience the atmosphere of six uniquely themed exhibits. Solve puzzles of varying difficulty. Stuck on a puzzle? Go explore and come back to it! Learn the history of death through the ages. Admire real death-themed artwork from different cultures and time periods. Monarchs, prisoners, deserters, and witches all have one thing in common - the occasional early demise at the hands of an executioner. Learn about execution methods from the middle ages to the 20th century then escape this exhibit unscathed. Spanish conquistadors wrote of their horror upon first witnessing Aztec sacrifices. You won't see anything quite so gruesome here, but you can see some artistic depictions inside the museum's Aztec-themed pyramid. Keep your head down while exploring this recreation of a World War II trench and you'll find your way to the dugout. Check out the collection of war posters and listen to real war-era radio broadcasts while you're there. Take a stroll through the museum's own mini-graveyard and enjoy the atmosphere of a starry night among the graves. Try out the interactive cremation exhibit, but don't let the dust get in your eyes.

You'll likely complete your tour in one visit, but you can leave and pick up where you left off at any time. No hand stamp required. There are no jump-scares in the museum. It's a little creepy, but nothing will pop up and scare you.

The Delaney family owned a large estate for generations, which was used for many things during the 20th century. All the horrible events that took place there remain unknown. Ophelia was forced to leave town and move to her aunt who raised her. Now, 10 years later, she is tormented by images from the past, suppressed memories and lucid dreams.

About the Project As a solo developer and a devout fan of survival horror, Eldervale is a passion project with the goal of reinvigorating a genre I feel is underrepresented in today's market.

423,"Rise of the Third Power is a love letter to the glory days of the console style RPG, with modern conveniences such as auto-save and a combination of the best elements of Japanese and Western style gameplay and writing. Experience this fusion of East and West, old and new, in a game meant to surpass Stegosoft Games' previous work in every way! STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for. 1587, 2A - 15 years have passed since the guns of the Great War at last fell silent. The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart. So did the people. They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too worn by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven successful. The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...",“Rise of the Third Power is a prime example of a true throwback gem.” RPGamer “Rise of The Third Power stands as a must-play for RPG fans.” PSU “It’s one of the very few games in recent memory that I couldn’t put down.” Way Too Many Games,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/header.jpg?t=1652169736,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_44fb285c665b2e6bf9b2cefe2dd8ac25bf3cea77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_500562fb9aee0e199e29c48864facf3cf69d9cc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_682039c16070bb26b913a4b5d9716f9bbb39e2c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_33ad90f0da2b744ed842638b30f0d64587d9fe20.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_15208b3bfbff7fa9d4b1fcc58b923fa28372ee1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_8d7f361b7ff195172298c87e6d3259e86fe71994.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_6bc55ecebe4298046a4531f8aecc33b7fe48b629.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_4edaef25c9b083c7433a5a87098bae69ab3ba043.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_33825406944c9a8a955ef9e6ae032cfd22ff9ae7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_64fe0bf5549e00043c12a7da64439b307e24ccc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_7d7580029e54b632d7f239a32580c4e54de573fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_98c8813d43cd0382ef9a5b76b111d2e9a16b6aa0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/698700/ss_e7571a05965e16e19e43d4b9bbe40a4c5e61a707.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652169736","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG"

428,"Siralim is a deep RPG with light roguelike elements that allows you to summon and customize hundreds of creatures to fight in strategic battle. Fight your way through randomly generated dungeons and complete randomized quests. Find rare treasure and use it to upgrade your castle, empower your creatures, craft powerful artifacts, learn new spells, and much more. Every dungeon in Siralim is randomly generated. This means that you'll never visit the same dungeon twice! Each dungeon also contains randomly generated quests, so there will always be fresh content for you to explore. Capture and summon over 300 unique creatures to fight for you. Each creature has its own, unique abilities which affect the way you'll approach the game. You can have up to 6 creatures in your party at a time. Can you assemble the ultimate team? You can also craft and enchant equipment for your creatures. Some of the most powerful equipment in the game also bestows new abilities to your creatures. Add new rooms, unlock new creatures, and entice citizens to live in your castle by purchasing upgrades for it. As the ruler of Siralim, it falls on you to decide when to improve your castle. The whole point of the game is that it never ends. There is no level cap, and there are thousands of hours of content for you to enjoy. Randomly generated dungeons and quests - no two dungeons are alike! Capture and summon over 300 unique creatures to fight for you. Each creature has its own unique abilities which directly affect the way you play the game. Cast over 100 powerful spells to turn the tide of battle. Fight in challenging battles that reward thoughtful strategy rather than mindless button mashing. Upgrade your castle to add new rooms, to unlock new creatures, and to entice new citizens to live in your kingdom. Craft and enchant equipment to augment your creatures' power or to grant them new abilities. There are over 500 different crafting materials to collect and use.

768,"Meet Blot . He's your everyday regular doodle with a vengeance... and a giant gatling gun . Help Blot along on his quest to take down the fearsome dictator known as Art . Shoot, propel, and pogo your way through dozens of challenging levels to fulfill Blot's destiny! Loads of levels! Strange, yet oddly charming, boss fights! A unique, physics-based way of movement. Quirky humor and jokes. Is this a plus? I honestly don't know. It's a hard game. Both a pro and a con! STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS TO PROVE YOUR TERRIBLE TENDENCY TO BE A COMPLETIONIST! Gatlin' is a physics-based platforming bullet hell where you are the bullet hell! Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying. You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right. I hear you asking, 'What causes me to die?' That is an oddly-morbid question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die to tears. By the way, that last thing is both figurative and literal . The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to. Each boss also reveals c r i s p y lore and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I guess. The endgame of Gatlin' is a distinctive twist on the existing gameplay. After the conclusion of the main story, level modifiers are unlocked. Want levels to be more difficult? We've got you covered. Imagine Hell itself. Good work. Now imagine Hell without gravity and now every surface is covered in soap. Get the picture? Does Hell not sound appealing enough for you? Understandable, everyone's a critic. Instead, we offer a wide array of eccentric and ever-expanding levels, worlds, and challenges to partake in. Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind. If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said, we highly encourage speedrunning .",“Gatlin' is a new indie game where you have to kill Mona Lisas and use your gatling gun to propel you around the levels.

The Austrians tried to interest the Confederacy in steam warships, many of them gunboats. With the New Orleans ironclads, they could present a dangerous challenge to the Union navy on the high seas, potentially capable of overwhelming squadrons on individual blockading stations. In reality, the deal never took place - but it could have happened! Create your fleet and army, hunt the enemy's fleet, hide your weak squadrons in protected ports until reinforcements arrive, blockade enemy trade routes, amphibious assaults and harbour sieges, struggle for dominance over the seas in turned-based strategic mode - All of these actions are possible in Ironclad 2 American Civil War . The real time tactical battle mode allows you to set up battles and squadron groups with their formations and management using realistic ship models and characteristics as well as advanced ballistics and weapon models. Choose your ships, increase the experience of your crews and send your squadron into the high seas. Command a battle formation and experience the power of iron and steam in a turned-based maritime strategy mode while fighting battles with a tactical real time naval simulation game. Raise anchor and get Ironclads 2 American Civil War now!","“The simple yet pithy strategic layer gives battles new weight, new meaning... The new turn-based strategic game works rather well. During the course of a 48 month/turn campaign, there are thought-provoking choices aplenty. Should I invest in another shore battery at Mobile or invest in something more mobile at Mobile? Should I expand my merchant fleet in the hope of generating some quick trade receipts, or focus on constructing the seagoing warships necessary to protect that merchant fleet? Am I ready to attack Key West, or would it be better to concentrate on strengthening the blockade there?” Rock Paper Shotgun “Strategic Layer. That this even exists is one of my favorite things about this game. Totem Games avoided this pitfall by designing a strategic layer to the game from which the tactical battles are generated. This feature adds replayability and puts weight behind the battles you fight. Tactical Layer. The graphics are surprisingly high-end for a small studio. The ship models are very good quality and have re-skins at different levels of damage, showing pockmarks and scorch marks from cannon hits. Fires, when they occur, look very nice, and the smoke from fires and the powerplants is very well done. Ships list when taking on water.

843,"Stirring Abyss is an indie tactical squad-based game with strong RPG elements in which you uncover the ancient mysteries of the depths depicted in the classic vein of Lovecraftian horror. You take charge of the surviving crew of the USS Salem, a U.S. Navy submarine that sinks while on a top secret research mission during the early years of the Cold War. They find themselves surrounded by the ruins of a forgotten civilization, their vessel too badly damaged to escape the seabed. In Story Mode, you slowly unravel the mysteries of the depths in a desperate quest to rescue your missing crewmembers and fix the crippled Salem. The choices you make determine the fate of your crew - and the entire world. Every expedition lives or dies by the strength of its crew. You have a diverse array of character traits and skills at your disposal, each opening exciting new options in both combat and in story events. As you delve ever deeper, you may also subject your crew to powerful but grisly mutations; the price of survival is high, and no one escapes the abyss unchanged. The horror and the void which hide in deep waters can become too much to bear, and your crew may experience episodes of exhaustion and insanity. Will their psyche get stronger, or will it be forever damaged? A game of dice with Fate itself will determine the outcome. Salvaged resources can be turned into weapons, armor, or other useful supplies - or they can be used to repair and upgrade the Salem, giving your crew a crucial edge in the fight for survival. The more you explore the abyss during the missions, the more chances you have to find the lost treasures of the deep. The hauntingly beautiful environment holds many secrets and mysteries to explore, but danger lurks just outside the feeble circles of light you bring with you. Be wise, and use your skills to scout the black waters and light up the path: unseen terrors may be hiding just out of sight. The Endless Mode pits your crew in a roguelike battle against an army of neverending enemies that only grow stronger as you progress. It is the ultimate test of strategic ability, as you not only choose how to improve your own squad, but also pick your poison as to what powers your foes gain.","“I really dig the way it embraces the aesthetic of the subject matter.

853,"The gates of Heaven are closed shut; the realm of Hell consumed by flood. And in their wake, countless parallel worlds wither away, one after the other. The surviving angels and demons gather at the city they believe to be their final chance at salvation: the floating purgatory of 'Tokyo Babel'. Joined by humans, they embark on a pilgrimage across the seven layers of Babel, hoping to ascend Jacob's Ladder in an effort to re-open the gates of Heaven. Their journey would be an atonement toward the heavens. And yet, their plans fall into ruin as a group of pilgrims - their minds consumed by madness - set out to lord over the numerous layers of Tokyo Babel with the intention to wreak complete and utter havoc atop the floating purgatory. Amidst this neverending impasse, a lone youth is saved from the ruins of his devastated world - Tendou Setsuna, a man denied human treatment since birth. Joining his savior, Lilith - known as the Witch of the Night, he begins his journey across Tokyo Babel... ...yearning for an answer to a single question: Why he still possesses the will to keep on living.","“This is a full priced release from MangaGamer, at $34.95, and in my opinion, it is definitely deserving of the premium.

857,"Visit a quiet town in the Peruvian desert at night searching for spirits and taking photos, then sharing these pictures with locals who free-associate based on them. This game is based on time I spent with a brujo in the desert suburb of Cachiche, a town that was founded by witches during the Peruvian Inquisition. Here descendants of witches still live and continue to practice traditional healing and fortune-telling. FEATURES Explore a 3D world with ambient sounds, voices and textures from the Peruvian desert, a living environment at night. Use your photography as a means of conversing with non-player characters, revealing what they see as well as what they imagine. See yourself as an outsider, lurking in alleys, eavesdropping on conversations, going where you're not supposed to go. Watch the forces of tourism at work and the conflicts rumbling beneath the surface of a small town. Discover that your camera is not just a passive recorder, but that its act of observation can change the environment. Complete progressively more abstract quests and delusional journal entries. Export and share your photos.","“What works here is that uncertainty space... In a number of places you’ll see shadows that don’t have a body.

868,"Developer's Note Hi, I'm Alex Schearer the founder of Spotted Zebra Software. I've been making games for a while, but always in two dimensions. I wanted to learn how to make 3D games and decided that making a game a week was a good, challenging way to do so. Arrowpoint is my second week long game. You've got a bow, a horse, and a burning desire for glory. Luck would have it that there's a mysterious beast wandering the desert nearby, so what are you waiting for? Go forth and leave your mark on the world! Arrowpoint is a simple game about hitting a bunch of targets and waging battle with a huge beast. It's fun because firing arrows from horseback is fun and because waging war with giants is fun. I'm releasing Arrowpoint for one dollar so people can join me in this crazy game-a-week adventure. If you'd like to share your thoughts, please leave a review or post to the Steam forums. If I get enough feedback I will improve the game based on what player's want. Thanks for reading this; I really hope you enjoy the game! Alex Schearer - Spotted Zebra Software Gameplay Ride your horse and fire at increasingly more challenging targets.

917,"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. Features: Survive the Wild West with the cleverness of a young hero Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles Use a playful arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes Inspire other children towards the path to freedom Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","“Honig Studios’s awareness of the genre it’s stepping into and its visual sophistication suggests good things for a dreamlike spaghetti-western” Killscreen “A stealth game set in a spaghetti western setting, developed by Honig studio.

952,"You are the Elder. You had a vision of a doomed future, so you took a handful of Pips, your fellow villagers, and led them to an empty valley to start anew. They need your guidance to survive the events foretold by the Prophecy, so make sure your Pips work hard! Dotage has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games. Build your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources. Take your time and think carefully before passing the turn! The memories of the Elder are unclear, so each run will be different, with new buildings to discover. Play with more than 200 buildings, 30 professions, and 70 resources. As you play, the memories of the Elder will come back, unlocking new game mechanics and content, such as new ailments, the mysterious VIPs, and new Elders! Each turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village. From poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse? In addition to each run being different, the game has multiple difficulty levels, so pick the one that suits your playstyle. Enjoy a relaxed turn-based town builder with its cozy graphics, or prove your mastery of the prophecy with the increasingly difficult mastery levels!

Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way... Customize your heroes the way you want. The game contains 54 weapons, 150 different types of armor and accessories, and 92 unique skills and spells for the heroes to learn. Additionally, there are 54 gems to equip, which enhance the heroes' skills in different ways. The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time! There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will help or hinder you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed during the fight. Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends. No grinding. The game is a linear adventure focusing on battles, visual novel segments, and visiting merchants to resupply. Difficulty can be changed at any time, even during dialogue. Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting. Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, and can damage an enemy's armour. The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, coming to terms with the world's true nature, and the concept of trust. Characters Aedric Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know. In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well. Rhea A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him. Although immature at times, and quick to anger, Rhea is loyal to those she loves, and will often put herself in danger, without a second thought. In battle, Rhea fights with her fists, delivering quick strikes, which allow her to build stamina quickly. Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act more often than her friends. Athena Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes. She is burdened by the guilt of her past, and is incredibly consumed with how the world, and her Goddess, perceives her. In battle, Athena is capable of treating the wounds of her allies, purging them of ailments, and bringing them back from the brink of death.

Manipulate the elements to turn the battlefield to your advantage, but beware the consequences, as nature is complex and fickle. Open chasms, raise mountains, boil lakes, drain rivers. Start fires you later regret. VAST OPEN-WORLD EXPLORATION Unearth ancient ruins, discover strange artefacts, and meet new friends, in a lush, painterly world. Explore the reaches of the archipelago by boat. Take to the skies as a bird to survey the landscape and plan the best route forward. For a generation, the terrible Fog - one vast, voiceless, and cruel spirit - has been eating the once-thick forests of the mainland. Now, with nowhere left to call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin towns of the rocky coast, discover the truth of the Fog, and, if possible, put an end to it.

The Controls The controls for Just Ski are borrowed from an old, abandoned game called Ski Stunt Simulator. Your only control over the skier is to move your mouse down to make him crouch or up to make him extend. It's a very simple to understand mechanic but requires a healthy amount of practice to master.

1819,"Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered.

The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows.
