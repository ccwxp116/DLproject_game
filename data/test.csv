13,"Midnight Heist is a co-op horror where you go on a heist through Midnight City alone or with up to three friends. As a relatively inexperienced hacker, you get the chance to perform tasks for well-known organizations. If you manage to complete these tasks, your reputation will increase and you will be trusted, while you will be rewarded. However, pay close attention to who hires you. The tasks will not be without danger. It is rumored that especially at midnight strange shadows move through the office buildings. According to reports, strange figures roam around various companies from midnight onwards. We're not sure what exactly is meant by these figures, but be on the lookout for danger in any case. Try to leave as few traces as possible, complete your task and escape. You can break into the companies with up to three more companions and distribute the tasks to grab even bigger rewards. However, keep in mind that more thieves means more attention. After receiving a job, you will have to break into a company. Depending on the job, you'll have a variety of tasks. Usually, you'll have to connect to computers in the company to steal data that is relevant for your client. At the same time, there will be some important documents and objects lying around in the company that you can take and steal to increase your loot. Black Hats The Black Hats are an organization that exploits every weakness in the system to get to their goal. They don't care about losses and use shady methods to reach their goal almost every time. They will use any means to get their prey. Satoshi Satoshi is an organization that does everything for money. No matter if companies and people have to be attacked or protected. As long as they end up being richly rewarded for their work, any means is fine with them. Accordingly, they only go for the jobs that are the most lucrative for them. Shadow Nobody really knows who or what is behind the Shadow organization. Some rumor that this organization is led by only one person. Shadow always appears exactly when no one suspects it and gives special missions that only the best hackers and thieves can fulfill. You'll be able to choose one of four available characters. By completing heists, your character will gain experience that can let you increase in level. We also plan to add a shop in the future where you can spend your earned money on skins to customize your characters.",“Midnight Heist is a pulse-pounding co-op horror game that brilliantly fuses the tension of Phasmophobia with the intrigue of Among Us” 8.5 / 10 – Rectify Gaming “Think Payday with a spooky twist!” 4 / 5 – Thumb Culture,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/header.jpg?t=1699585197,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_55ec29ae6078d6b2aae731e508556be313d778b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_9ce62243b27f59a717cd55e16ed658fb7e1409ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_82e2b2e5ab35510c547cbd0593d07cc6ef4f176a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_07364ec2d270d7b0d7c0b4a8e75a0916a65d6a86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_335d8d535c07fd2a9a6d159ad7e205a31b34f7be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_8ab2613df14c6c5bf76b383d2ab3529f600646e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_cd5a57926bec595feabcdf4b43ac8eca0ae13cef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_be942711637e2764531cdab8c775fc8ba69b33c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_73dd3c5879cf6aebf65ebb6c3dcc2cc7eea55965.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_dc0c37ce5ca77f233152110cfd36823aaa246fb1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_1e199c0422a3200c5c9ac2bdca7976de30ff6ce6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_cff0a0cb97a4d6ecf9e9da1c388d49edb5024cbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_4b904d7072bf3b29ec2a34c81ddc96e15805ee56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_d661c3bf4666d87292c6b0e3abc756addede1ce9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_a770a6292f2ae5d2725718f005b30c30c269a025.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_366fe94a106ee87b365f217dd2c8959aa7815aa1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_9a383cfb8d456b94f8d4a155d25e1f5353e932e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2204350/ss_9a0b37bd85bd4796dcdf5bb622360f3c15b46680.1920x1080.jpg?t=1699585197","Action,Adventure,Indie,Simulation,Early Access"
18,"A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration. Explore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters. There are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened. You will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. The game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.","“If you’re looking for an experience with a unique setting and some very uncommon enemy types, One Little Serf’s debut project will be right up your valley.” GamingPurists",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/header.jpg?t=1583924464,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_c09643df67f116b5a1e99f6152024779bb8c2c1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_0c9623ab4f869387efe8c8ad242625486b79dbd9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_837e2acda17018ba62a45cc4b83f6c52952df05e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_de18bfb7f163c3610d19fef200585a262ddb3922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_e6fb3f65cca04134c3b7935ff40ed3e99fcfe61a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464",RPG

30,"Are ghosts real? You are on your first solo ghost hunting case, under the watchful instructions of Bear and Jen from the O.P.G paranormal team. Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy.

Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views.

35,"A Guidebook of Babel is a story-adventure game based on the butterfly effect. It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase! You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel! If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel! From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures! You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force! Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation! Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook. It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain! The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation. Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!","“A Guidebook Of Babel seems to be fanciful and open-minded, but the gameplay is quite mature and the plot is practical and interesting enough. Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, 'Babel' obviously handles both the 'storytelling' and 'puzzle solving' parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then 'A Guidebook Of Babel' is definitely worth watching.” 8.2 – Gamersky “Due to the game's dynamic and fluid design, the surprises of A Guidebook Of Babel will always be endless - every time you think the previous level is foolproof, the next level will immediately break your illusion, telling you that you need to observe carefully, and the story is far less simple than you think. Reverse, reverse and reverse, you can never guess where the story is going, and even if the player has the perspective of God, it will be like being in a mountain, but not seeing the mountain.” 3DM “These things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops. It was also after reading the whole story that I realized that A Guidebook Of Babel is not just a story about a book and a ship, but also a story about the boat maker.” 游研社",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/header.jpg?t=1691389011,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_3f1d7b20597e608191747fd976d7087a8d791a11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_959b248bcbd8774b5ad0097dd1e8bf70af563e0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_9526dcdf81461eb05938951a983c6e969a238d23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5a1d9100408c22aa29d9eaaa9f40aba32cecbd86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5e9e3afec130dc8523b89ec2ef7d6f2745b13e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ed6e7aa76010e68f17e792bcfd98f50f96150c3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_29d12518ad31e00e5a93d1173d0142fb834393f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7faef5ff0d0ea38a04595558cfb38ca35d25f8de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_10f361c2988ce772846f56981d2094f3f81bf96c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7212d5aaf311c52643743a490527794caf969ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_d5bf1c2127b82ca45d1f81dd6ea58fb9d3ebe364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ef320cad58168822bbaec341baae49e587155632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_1f4b4db9b38177f3f6a4b7bbc7ba742f757dba87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_efbe3f7ccf39d48306082c4d212ff285b8dca582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011","Adventure,Indie"

64,"2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism. The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation. One of the major terrorist groups created a secret base in the jungle and started the project 'Confluence', combining plant cells with human cells. The group of scientists that worked on this experimental process also raised an army of soulless bio-soldiers to guard the project. But during the final experiment, 'Confluence' went out of control and began taking over its surroundings. You, as one of the best mercenaries, will have to stop the project in the only way possible: break into its epicenter and blast it to smithereens! The game takes its roots from classic first-person shooters, a series of games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny, Operation Bodycount, Blake Stone and many others. The color palette is taken from Operation Bodycount, while the game uses a unique graphical style, approximately similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

84,"VRQB is the definitive arcade VR football experience. You are the quarterback, driving down the field while racking up as many points as possible. Experience the excitement of classic arcade football from the quarterback's perspective! Players can choose from five different footballs that each offer their own unique play style. VRQB currently features three game modes with three different difficulty levels: Classic , Two Minute Drill , and Scramble . Classic In Classic mode, the player drives down the field by hitting groups of three targets spread out across the field. Clearing each set of targets gives the player a first down, enabling the player to move down the field. The player tries to reach the end zone while increasing their multiplier by hitting consecutive targets. Two Minute Drill In the Two Minute Drill, the player has two minutes to score as many points as possible. The player has the option of hitting three different targets, moving to the location of the target hit. Players must weigh hitting the closer, reliable targets to build up a streak multiplier, or airing it down the field and going for the big gain. Scramble In Scramble mode, the player dodges the VRQB tackling dummies while trying to score as many touchdowns as possible.

You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data. To get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.

345,"Welcome to The Lonely Gorilla store page! This is a animal survival game in the tropical African rain forests and grasslands. A living, breathing environment. Advanced AI simulating animal behaviour. Full climate and weather system. What do you do in the game? Explore Rain-forests, grasslands and mountain ranges. Role play as a wild silver-back Gorilla separated from his troop. You must survive the harsh environment finding food, water and shelter. The ultimate goal is to be reunited with your troop, then protect them against predators and the environment. Can you regain their bonding after the separation? As the alpha male only you can keep the troop together and have the right to mate with the females to produce offspring. If bonding is not high this will not occur, and can even lead to challenges from rival males for troop leader status. As food resources dwindle, you must lead your troop to new areas while keeping them safe. How long can you survive? The game is an indie experience from a small team with a focus on the environment and wildlife. We want to give you a true feeling of this amazing, vastly unexplored area of our planet. Highly detailed environments. Full day night cycle and accurate climate system. Plant growth system. Danger from poachers. Threat from predators and rivals. We hope you enjoy exploring the beauty of the grasslands, rivers, and rain-forests of Africa. Authentically crafted terrain, vegetation and animals.

396,"Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare is set in a chaos filled world occupied by battling factions, bandits and warlords who seek to rule the world. The game is about your career as a faction leader: Start with minimal assets, you need to make money, build an army, wage wars against other factions and eliminate your rival forces with thoughtful strategies and fine marksmanship and eventually conquer the world. The game provides a completely different shooter experience which strikes a balance between intense first-person action and general strategy . The game's innovative combat system blends tactical FPS with real-time strategy, allowing you to command an army, plan for tactics in the God view, while immersing in the intense firefight as a foot soldier, in the first-person perspective. Features: FPS meets Sandbox Strategy Game Start your career with almost nothing, you must make money, recruit soldiers, loot villages, fight bandits, attack territories and dominate the world. The game is a combination of challenging action and a wider strategic theater. Shooter and Real-Time Strategy Experience the unique combat system which blends real-time strategy with tactical first-person shooter. You are expected to strategically plan the movements and tactics of multiple squads in addition to having to be an eagle-eyed sharpshooter and possessing catlike reactions. Realistic Combat Simulation The game is about realism. Killing 100 enemies with only a pistol is not possible. You will be challenged by highly intelligent AI that is capable of advanced tactical maneuvers such as flanking, surrounding and even fake retreating, almost like what you would experience in real combat. Only carefully planned tactics, equipment, and cooperation between squads can bring you victory. Are you up to the challenge? High Re-playability The random nature of starting points, enemy AI and objectives will make every battle feel different and challenging. There is no linear gameplay: You have the freedom to decide how to progress in the game, who to fight, what equipment and squads to use and how to dominate the world.

430,"SUMMARY Here, you will be challenged, hurt, and angered... For this, I pity you. I created this game not for you to win but for you to fail. The blockchain doesn't care about your saved file. It doesn't care whether you want to adjust your sensitivity or if you can't 'figure it out'. This game exists simply because it can. I am here to design a game that will break you, not out of spite, but because I am The Dev, and I can. If you beat this game, you are a true dev with honor. Good luck. GAMEPLAY 'The Dev: Enter The Blockchain' is a brutally punishing and annoying third-person 3D platforming game centered around the character, The Dev. In this game, you will play through multiple levels, each with its unique puzzles and challenges. From an arcade shooter level to a 3D platformer level, you'll experience the trials The Dev faces when entering the blockchain. This game unfolds within the photo-realistic, impeccably coded world of The Dev. Witness the inner workings of the blockchain, traverse the trailer park in 3D, and bask in the pure, unadulterated bliss of Dev Island. Your objective: progress through the levels to ultimately reunite with your most treasured possession. Levels you'll encounter include Dev Island, Ponzi Park, and even the blockchain itself. The clock is ticking. KEY FEATURES Enriched single-player narrative driven campaign Limited Settings - Keybindings, audio levels, mouse sensitivity... Adjust none of it. My game is perfectly balanced. Live Action Cut Scenes - You will experience live action cut scenes directly from The Dev himself made special for this game. Totally unskippable Immersive 3D Audio - Enjoy the atmosphere of ocean waves on Dev Island or the synth soundscape of the blockchain Full Graphic Scaling - So that regardless of your system, The Dev will be optimized for you. No loot boxes, micro-transactions or ANY additional purchases required - With the purchase of this game, you will never have to pay for any other content regardless of what it is in the future. Zero Customization - Enjoy the game how The Dev intended. Ponzi Boy Slaying - Live your wildest dreams as you take out the Ponzi Boy virtually inside this game Next Level Jumping Puzzles These will blow your mind and make you want to rip your hair out.

489,"Ghostory is a 2D platformer designed around switching between physical and ghostly forms in order to solve increasingly taxing puzzles. Despite starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns. Ghostory won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016. In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form, they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow them to survive and escape the cave unscathed. The game comes packed with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls, always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles. Complex, occasionally fiendish puzzles. Dozens of unique levels. Smooth animations, and quality pixel art. Engagingly deep plot complete with rather silly puns. Atmospheric music to tie in with the detailed environments of each level. Smooth and responsive controls. Important mushrooms. In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods. Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will. Thankfully, an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote, but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.","“Do you love puzzle games?

The Devil has converted a tenement building into monsters-only housing, and has big plans for the future. Sucker monsters into moving into your building, charge them rent and keep them happy by buying them furniture. Unfortunately, heroes have caught wind of the Devil's plan, and will stop at nothing to wipe him out. Knock on residents' doors to call them to battle, trap heroes in devious pincer formations, and command your troops to victory. Monsters get jobs, fall in love, have children, and even skip out on their rent. Keep them happy or you might not have anyone to fight for you when heroes come knocking. But don't be too soft: there's always prospective baddies looking to move in, so kick out the freeloaders when the time is right! Being a landlord is a difficult job, but it can't be harder than running Hell...right? Every monster is different. Some are lazy. Some are strong. Some are perverts. Use an intuitive mouse-based control scheme to command your troops into battle. Encounter more than 20 different monster species, and take their money. Build a reputation with different monster families based on your performance and play style. Take on quests at your pace to unlock new monsters and furniture. Build a stronger army as residents have children far stronger than themselves. Get monsters in the mood for love with inappropriately shaped erotic cakes. Look on in horror as lovingly hand-drawn monsters and humans horribly slaughter each other over money.

Wynona is a depressed young girl who is convinced she is the Doom Bringer that will end the world. His final task is to kill her and she's trying to die - it should be a match made in heaven. But here's the catch: She's unkillable.

723,"Ripped Pants at Work is a frantic stealth game about searching for new pants. Players control an ordinary office worker on their first day of work. After an unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for new pants. Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some pants are easy to find. Some are a bit trickier! This happens to everybody! Ripping your pants is one of those things that everyone can sympathize with, but it's still so embarrassing. Every time you play, you'll control a new, randomly generated character! If you find pants successfully, you'll continue as the same person. If you get caught with no pants, you'll be fired and play as the next person hired for the job! Sneak through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and people. Break line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across streets and through buildings with a unique brand of stealth. Play the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If you get caught pantsless by too many people, you'll get fired for indecency. The cycle continues with the next person to get hired for your job. Best your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in the shortest amount of time!","“For three bucks on Steam it’s a no-brainer if you’re looking for a good way to kill time before bed or, if you’re a true sneaky mastermind, at work while you should be writing memos and whatnot.” 8/10 – Game Space “Nearly everything about this game is an absolute delight...” 85/100 – Steam Shovelers “The game, needless to say, is very funny.

737,"DISCLAIMER FOR ADDITIONAL USER REVIEWS , please visit the 'Company of Heroes - Legacy Edition' page. Total conversions available on Steam for COH1 are also listed on the Legacy Edition page. DESCRIPTION Delivering a visceral WWII gaming experience, Company of Heroes redefines real time strategy gaming by bringing the sacrifice of heroic soldiers, war-ravaged environments, and dynamic battlefields to life. Beginning with the D-Day Invasion of Normandy, players lead squads of Allied soldiers into battle against the German war machine through some of the most pivotal battles of WWII. Through a rich single player campaign, players experience the cinematic intensity and bravery of ordinary soldiers thrust into extraordinary events. A Cinematic Single Player Experience that captures the turmoil of WWII as never before.

Stunning Visuals - Relic's next generation cutting-edge engine provides graphic quality and a physics driven world that is unprecedented in an RTS. Environmental Strategy - Real-time physics and a completely destructible environment guarantee no two battles ever play out in the same way. Destroy anything and re-shape the battlefield! Use buildings and terrain to your advantage, or deny them to the enemy. 2-8 Player Multiplayer Competition via LAN or Internet - Go online with friends and join the ultimate battle of Axis versus Allies.","“It's beautiful, though that's entirely the wrong word. This is a war game, so the word should be 'visceral' or something. Models are hugely detailed for an RTS, physics implemented impressively and so on. But relevantly, it's a functional sort of beauty (or - er - viscerality).” 10/10 – Eurogamer “Company of Heroes should be on the must-play list of every RTS fanatic out there, even those tired of WWII settings. It's just that good.” 9.6/10 – PC Gamer “The transformation from a idyllic little town into a heap of crushed buildings and burned out husks of vehicles can be shocking. Seeing and hearing major explosions that cause bodies (and bits of bodies) to fly across the screen along with rubble from a nearby building simply puts you more into the battle than any RTS in memory.” 9.4/10 – IGN",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/header.jpg?t=1632304482,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a02fbfb9a63def39ad5dce6f52435820a3338242.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_07254123cc0b22872f31ee55eb3f0d8f004a7c85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a965a0017ad2d2eb8b048c479e2425550191d2dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_535b5736857c63e4a7a786b90a03e30a07f8220e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_290136d7dba4eaf7c15f7cc2c58e6f1b52bc0072.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_4069148ca5c574d40ba4f3ac323c51a6ce040ea6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_02cf401290f1a8faf7fc15ba44aac553359d9cc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482","Action,Strategy"

745,"SoundSelf is the collision of centuries-old mindfulness wisdom and the videogame trance. It's an exhilarating journey into altered states of consciousness powered by your own voice.

You will hear about the eight Master Explorers and the artist, writer and inventor, the unique and perfect Mivos Esterus. EONIA is a game to be enjoyed alone. A vast and colorful place where you must explore every corner to know its mysteries and legends. You will find books and scrolls that will help you learn new skills and discover the rich history that surrounds it. There are dozens of items and a wide variety of skills. You can navigate by boat and over land to travel long distances in seconds thanks to the Magic Portals that the Forgotten Civilization built years ago. You can build structures and the chests and their mysteries will not be a difficult task if you have a lockpick and the necessary knowledge. A skill tree will show you everything you already know and how much you need to learn. Let's not forget that Albius is a simple apprentice. A complete inventory will allow you to track objects and know their characteristics and uses. A mission journal will allow you to understand what remains to be done and what adventure to continue. Life surrounds each stone and you will have to learn what advantage you can get from it through all kinds of books. Books are an inexhaustible source of knowledge in the EONIA world and there are many of them and, perhaps with a little luck, you will be able to solve the mysteries of EONIA.

917,"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. Features: Survive the Wild West with the cleverness of a young hero Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles Use a playful arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes Inspire other children towards the path to freedom Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","“Honig Studios’s awareness of the genre it’s stepping into and its visual sophistication suggests good things for a dreamlike spaghetti-western” Killscreen “A stealth game set in a spaghetti western setting, developed by Honig studio.

1007,"A young man awakens in a forest, deep in the Hinodean wilds. He doesn't remember how he got there, or where he needs to be. Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way... Customize your heroes the way you want. The game contains 54 weapons, 150 different types of armor and accessories, and 92 unique skills and spells for the heroes to learn. Additionally, there are 54 gems to equip, which enhance the heroes' skills in different ways. The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time! There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will help or hinder you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed during the fight. Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends. No grinding. The game is a linear adventure focusing on battles, visual novel segments, and visiting merchants to resupply. Difficulty can be changed at any time, even during dialogue. Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting. Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, and can damage an enemy's armour. The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, coming to terms with the world's true nature, and the concept of trust. Characters Aedric Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know. In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well. Rhea A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him. Although immature at times, and quick to anger, Rhea is loyal to those she loves, and will often put herself in danger, without a second thought. In battle, Rhea fights with her fists, delivering quick strikes, which allow her to build stamina quickly. Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act more often than her friends. Athena Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes. She is burdened by the guilt of her past, and is incredibly consumed with how the world, and her Goddess, perceives her. In battle, Athena is capable of treating the wounds of her allies, purging them of ailments, and bringing them back from the brink of death. Additionally, Athena possesses powerful prayers, which increase various aspects of her friends' offensive and defensive strengths.

The presence of moments where the player's choices affect what happens next. Nice visual style and atmosphere of the cold, winter world. Atmospheric soundtrack to keep the right mood. Important note: the game was created by one person, so it can not offer a long duration. On average, it takes an hour and a half to get through the game. It's important to me that you know this before you buy, so you won't be disappointed about it afterwards. Thank you for your understanding!","“Once in Flowerlake is a game to pass a few hours with. It may be on the short side as to playtime but the price point reflects this. I do think the game could have some dark tones added to it so the main character can be seen a little more clearly and adjust the text so it can be read without the player having to climb into the screen. There are a few twists and turns in the plot that keep you hooked to push on to see its conclusion.” I Like It – LadiesGamers “Once in Flowerlake is an atmospheric game for people with patience, and I genuinely mean that in the nicest possible way. It portrays individual components well, such as stagnant routine, temporary friendships, a foreign world, and what trudging through snow feels like, but all of these elements mixed together get in each other’s way at times. If you feel to your core that life is about the journey, not the destination, Once in Flowerlake is a tiny yet tantalizing tale worth playing through.” 3/5 – Hey Poor Player",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/header.jpg?t=1642282701,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4f917411b92bf7f7cd7eb5a8d9e493496fd1b290.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_47f5bb873000670355ced7e84e6f4f7f2a9b992b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_9a3bfa37192c5f4b40463722da5d7398ab7af92a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4ad416e32e63c4fece0d6f58876e4f6711f5ec6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_92c10f6b3c25e774f03b9561f291e8ce17f2e069.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_8323875624f81f191cf5b74f39faa536f0d87196.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_05fbcfbc2c759ba752b1f4c0f63fb920845bd36d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_687223fffd4fc085987e5f17afdcb92050fc4aa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701","Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation"

Game pits heavily armed players against machines that have only one goal, destroy humanity. SETTING The world of machines is dark, violent and grim. They will not stop until all humans are dead. THE PLOT When an advanced weaponry base goes dark, George Flow is sent in to check things out. When boarded the transport carrier, the mention of advanced weaponry development, brought back flashbacks. Flow remembered the day many years prior, when he was at school. He remembered sitting in the office and staring outside the window for his parents to arrive. He remembered waiting and watching and no one ever showing up. Likely one of the most devastating sights was that of a police car driving up to the school. Its pace was slow. All George remembered was pain. His parents were dead. Gone forever. It felt surreal at the time. His father had been presenting newest and most versatile combat robot to date. The real achievement of Artificial Intelligence.

Yes, only if you're not good at it 'Simple' as in straightforward. Later levels in the game can be quite challenging There's a story but it's not shoved in your face NPCs don't keep you for too long. They don't beat around the bush or waste your time trying to be funny Some NPCs have a line of dialogue. Others might even be wearing hats. There are a total of four achievements to unlock You don't defeat an 'evil mastermind'. There's no boss fights I have ideas for Lovely Planet 2. I also have a prototype ready Look, I can't really explain why it's not a shooter game. I wanted to make a platformer, so I made a platformer. Okay? You're still reading this? Pro tip - there is in fact a second jump button the game never tells you about Here's the solution to level 32 - Jump straight down, hang a right and carefully crawl along the passage till you hit a left turn. From there, carefully drop to your right and go straight till you reach the end of the beam. Drop down to the platform below and follow the path to your left. You'll find an NPC there who will show you the rest of the way. Don't look for the Mad Wizard in the forest, the NPCs, they're lying to you","“The jumping is stiff, the enemies don’t move very much...” 3.5 – Saving Content “...a fun and challenging title where mechanics and the fluff of power ups are stripped down to let the actual platforming shine” Verdict : Buy – Pardon the Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/header.jpg?t=1618279716,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_d20adbef0ccaac948e4b1f46067d2a2bc06bba0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_effaac7b7d8b69d970d3613832c0f63635963829.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_3b5c3019dbafce55291418e5cfc30805e9d6b917.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_37ccfad23a08e424f2b40a5638d7d30798507de6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_7e224271e10c59255bdab1f08eb34bc9153b2d74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_5bf95940e4547f9d46f1fc5897c8965d273a4ee8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716",Indie

1132,"Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online! Featuring Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players. Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City. Modes and options: Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...

1308,"In her mid-20's, Kelly has been forced to move back to Nebraska. Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home. Three Fourths Home is a visual short story in which you assume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother. Three Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation. Gameplay As a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home . Between the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home. New to the Extended Edition For its Steam release, Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an expanded edit of the initial release as well as several new elements, including a new epilogue in addition to a number of extra features. Epilogue: Idling in the Rubble Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, Idling in the Rubble follows another conversation that Kelly has with her mother. The 20-30 minute experience delves into Kelly's past, examining her reasons for moving back to Nebraska and her internal struggle following the events of the main game.

But hey, we don’t come to puzzle games for the good looks. We’re here for the puzzles, and Pixel Boy has some good ones. Ninety-six stages in total, and the complexity of those stages often translates to a few mini-puzzles in each to solve. The goal in each stage is to push the red crate to the specified goal and then head into the exit that appears. You’ll have to deal with gimmicks like locked doors, pits, fire, and more.

Unlike most games where you experience worlds created by game designers, with AI Dungeon, you can direct the AI to create worlds, characters, and scenarios for your character to interact with.

Unlimited AI In this Steam release, AI Dungeon is offering its first-ever one-time purchase for an unlimited AI experience. On web and mobile versions, free play is action-limited, requires ads, and doesn't give access to premium model settings. In this exclusive Steam-only offering, you can play forever without worrying about energy limits. Unlimited access to Griffin, one of our language generation models Access to premium AI settings for Griffin No Ads Create Worlds Pick a character, a world, and a story.

1435,"Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments. Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator. The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.","“'Immersion” means different things to different players. Turn-based and RTS players identify so much with their units that they feel they are members of the force. Simulation and FPS players have even more visceral connections: they are virtually on the spot, spewing bullets and doing Split-Ss. Submarine simulations tend to combine both styles. The main position is the captain’s positions in the command center where he can pick targets by the periscope. He can also click on dials to control speed, course and depth. Some simulations can send players to specific compartments like engineering, fire control, sonar/radar, radio, even crew quarters via clicks on icons. Still, the player is in control with no real change in perspective. Skvader Studios’ – aided by Subsim.com -- Wolfpack gives a whole new dimension to submarine sims.” Wargamer “If you've ever dreamed of working on a 'highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War', Wolfpack is the game for you.” PC Gamer “'It was our second mission, so our three-man crew was a little nervous. Even though my two gaming buddies and I cracked jokes about our rather limited adventures at sea we knew that we were playing a game that was deadly serious. We were tasked with seeking out and destroying any British supply convoys that we came across in the frigid waters of the North Sea. Wolfpack is not an easy game.

This being said, this is an upfront disclaimer about a lot of repetitiveness in the gameplay as it is the case with older arcade games.

Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself. Victory doesn't come easy as you have to earn every single space credit out there fighting in over 50 missions. By clearing your mission objectives, reward is coming to your account and you're ready to upgrade your ship with decoys, shields, laser boosters and much more. You can even buy a new, better fighter. As you progress, you will get engaged in trading earned resources such as cobalt, nickel, palladium and others in trading room every space station features. Build your strategy by carefully choosing routes from your space station towards another and have your take in every mission.

Long before, there were Two, two brothers of The Ones Who Came Before; one of Light, one of Shadow. These brothers collided to form a third; one of Flame. The One King, burning with anger and hatred, created the Void that lives in all things; the barrier between realms to prevent his elder brothers from fighting further.

He then vanished, never to be seen again. YOLTRUND, THE GAME Experience the gripping tale as you play as a lost soul, trapped within Yoltrund, and must find his way out of the realm of eternal fire.

We have taken from platformers by adding simple platforming like gameplay, giving a different feel to what might be expected from a game like FoD. We have drawn from action games, making Floors of Discomfort a very fast paced, challenging, experience that will keep you on your toes the entire run. These three aspects come together to create a game that offers a unique experience that is both rewarding, and satisfying.",6.5/10 – Co-Op Couple,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/header.jpg?t=1447374965,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4f420cc0b695474101d498a1548432a024e91454.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_d7dea9e2e860e5106ec7cc426debeb052621dcb7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4fadedf78c2febc4570bc0161e06b7e330c6c4c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4db382f9078eee4c570d73572e1eba3bf261348a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_cf197c5bfdc433b55afdbb4d0f26f99081ceac7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_915a05cd832938cec1bbce4f386b4d5fa0f01852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965","Action,Indie,RPG"

Abilities Purchase and use several unique abilities to assist your fight, each catering to a different play style, whether or not ability is useful, is up to you, chain abilities together using secondary to further cater your gameplay.

1701,"Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe.

1807,"Set in a creepy amusement park hiding a dark and sinister secret, The Park is a one to two hour-long first-person psychological horror experience focusing on intense storytelling and exploration instead of combat and action. A day at the park... a lost teddy bear... a missing child. As the sun sets over Atlantic Island Park, you must explore its dilapidated rides in search of your son, Callum. As darkness falls, you will experience panic and paranoia through a narrative written by a team of award-winning storytellers. Amusement parks are happy places, filled with the joys of childhood and the exhilarating rush of fantastic rides to be dared.

No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words. Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.

1819,"Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered.

1907,"Land Doctrine is a 3D sandbox strategy game. You can design tanks, manage research, equip infantry, set up infantry training, optimize production and build combined arms battalions to crush your enemies. You have complete freedom to customize your army and you will need both superior designing and logistical skills as well as masterful tactics to outsmart your opponents and triumph on the battlefield. The combat system is based on measuring anti-tank firepower against armor and anti-personnel firepower against infantry cover while the combat distance gradually decreases during the battle. The terrain affects the starting distance of engagement, cover and tank maneuverability. Side, rear or top armor is exposed to enemy fire when tanks are fighting in complex environments, like woods, urban areas or marshland. It is an accurate and clever yet immediate system designed around the idea of optimizing your divisions. Therefore, research is an important part of the game. You can develop new tank engines, suspension, guns and infantry weapons or improve industrial efficiency and training methods. You can design a new tank, set up a production line to produce it and increase the production capacity by capturing enemy cities. Proper training is essential for victory. Inadequate training will cause increased casualties, while good training will generate combat bonuses. The training capacity is also limited: optimize carefully. You can manage infantry equipment at the platoon level. Select small arms and heavy weapons to provide the necessary firepower, then unleash it to see your enemies vanquished! Main features: - Randomly generated maps - More than 2100 possible tank designs - Tech tree with 99 research projects - Customizable infantry equipment with 23 infantry weapons - Custom training doctrines","“For just $5 it’s a damned good deal” 8/10 – The Strategy Gamer “The cost of entry is minimal, and though far be it for me to assess value for money, Land Doctrine is cheap enough to warrant satisfying curiosity.” Wargamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/header.jpg?t=1574261137,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_1b54cee2971b285be8d2a186088f9ab876ab88d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a08999934e066fa9fd3380af2ead93bc786ab7c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a0e8f8f832297e086a979ae26eb31b758b92ef04.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bde2ba1ff5101569fe3d43e852dc66f5a70db9db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_ed2b67833bd645c94a0127063714a269a486637d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bc299eaaa80f8d526c0fabbcba6bdeb2f1f04f60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_675050d42ddb62b9ca4977033fa3a3a1d6be06ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_6248933a509d548c71e9b73ab2d76ed19aa250d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_24c5c6b8d04afc6f302997c6280720055332ab52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_28591a67bee4874f67838b9c9d32327557e525d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_b2b74305e5ab375887c94c4f1ffccd8eaa1646ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f26030f74c37dfa9a44b8745bc0f69190ba81502.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_7f811deb7bbce013e59675c590e447980d3143b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_88faa81decdf1ff0c9ec926de357aff696c46462.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_c79a405a96f6b95187e0eaaef0896f3d9618f314.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_680c111b2f8eebb9665a0dcd9c0a4b3b6759225a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_5c7964dcbb89627afb3dd3759852587f8d5c3894.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_fa99b807ad54d7d1d163205511744ba9d28c8b9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_71b95b026d47c881c50d9912112c3d52eb50d4ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a8053b9d8f531163d4f83171937845abe693229b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_8c6bc33c52b89bc70a450ace6b84100a486b2291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f4b87415138d42efa681167d6107b13a16089f08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_e828f61c18eacc82873731dfa2a8e8ce72aa9950.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137","Indie,Strategy"

1960,"PRiO is a visually-striking, yet challenging platformer about manipulating the environment around you. To complete a stage, you must light up all the blocks in a level. The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.","“sharp gameplay that’s right at the sweet-spot between too tough and too easy” Indie Game Magazine “PRiO is punishing, but in the best possible way” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/header.jpg?t=1478028084,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_79ccab4e49d954efce2fa70da483d7a52f29053a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_536bb4fdca229cc1a7ab65687341aa0052558b6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_6da76fe06e8ea30723eb371b47a5e43ca38513dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_a5911b9a3df6318a5a5ae4dd5a583afea1f3861b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_2806fe65917768d21e8a4165c6f213c2f2c88437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_45518e5f667c5fb4d5a4efcbba69d3cb87b1248d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_972e56577c519056e1c54dc53db25d970e9e6b1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_add9cf6e0e090c946512879934b88d8ac02ca983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084","Action,Adventure,Indie"
