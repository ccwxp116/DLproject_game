Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it.

64,"2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism. The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation. One of the major terrorist groups created a secret base in the jungle and started the project 'Confluence', combining plant cells with human cells. The group of scientists that worked on this experimental process also raised an army of soulless bio-soldiers to guard the project. But during the final experiment, 'Confluence' went out of control and began taking over its surroundings. You, as one of the best mercenaries, will have to stop the project in the only way possible: break into its epicenter and blast it to smithereens! The game takes its roots from classic first-person shooters, a series of games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny, Operation Bodycount, Blake Stone and many others. The color palette is taken from Operation Bodycount, while the game uses a unique graphical style, approximately similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

It's very juicy, your slime leaves traces on walls he collides on making a satisfying sound. The levels progress really well, starting off easy for you to get the hangs of the controls, then becoming harder and harder as you advance. It's so simple to control, that might make you think that there isn't really a challenge there. But believe me, there is! And those are the types of challenges that aren't frustrating, because the level progression helps you understand how the game works, so you'll have the knowledge to complete the challenges, thus making you feel quite smart. The art is amazing! It's sort of realistic, but also there is the cartoony slime, making it look very unique and interesting. This is a must buy, specially for the price! DON'T WAIT FOR A SALE, that's just ridiculous, look at this price tag :P” Marcos “This game is about a slime, you must move to walls for be smashed and complete the stages. The Dungeon Slime in my first impression was only a game a little different, but when a started to play... I LOVED THE GAME! The puzzles are very challengers, and you need to be smart, not is impossibel and not is too easy. The visual is wonderful, with a great color palette, and a love the slime expressions. The music really make you feel inside the dungedon and the sounds emphasize the visual.” SaulRib_",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/header.jpg?t=1635844717,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_5e71ab1895371fbd4ccf45afb23261624caf7bc8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_56c527c910011b6b656f73da6019f5212561b422.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_7787b892b439f24d148ff3c2f8f2e20c35d81166.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_390d82677f4c9f8779a1e7dba9ce0ce3091af697.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_493a2be6c6fb3b91044c23f052d287914135c8aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_3996712c9d919f6813e8d7ddb41f5d54c9b615d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_ef5f517a641fc1318cd50a2155f653a779f9abd0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1455230/ss_097dd32fc16b33249e46a20b9dbc59f70bec1baf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635844717","Adventure,Casual,Indie,Strategy"

RETRO GAMEPLAY AND 1V1 PIZZA COMBAT The Final Specimen is a comedic sci-fi adventure game in the style of the classic 2D platformers of the '90s. Packed with whimsical settings and eccentric characters, this energetic, challenging title brings an exciting take to old-school gaming. The story begins when our hero, a young earthling, is transported to a distant planet. After facing sudden assault from the world's inhabitants, he soon finds out that his arrival is no coincidence. He is the only one who can prevent a nefarious alien foe from unleashing a terrible plot to rain destruction upon their home. The game's environments range from interstellar highways and sprawling cities to overgrown catacombs and creepy basements filled with enemies who want your head. From rope swings to disappearing platforms, there is never a shortage of new obstacles to navigate. And if the ability to punch your enemies' lights out isn't enough, you can always collect ammunition: your personal stash of bombs and more bombs. You are the culmination of years of alien experimentation. You are the only human who stands a chance. You are THE FINAL SPECIMEN.","“The Final Specimen Arrival actually comes across as one of the funniest games I've seen this year by far.

288,"The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating allowing you to improve the area by improving public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. You are free to go at your own pace and take it easy. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.","“A brilliant blend of Stardew Valley and old-school JRPG, topped with a sprinkling of intriguing puzzles and minigames to keep it fresh” 9/10 – Pocket Tactics “It’s more a game about revitalization than it is about the passage of time, yet I could spend many more hours in Moonbury completing quests and concocting potions” I Like it a lot – Ladies Gamers",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/header.jpg?t=1664044256,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_4f753150a0fa1e0124297e1cf2ea28d0ae730b0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_3d1d74a72c6fa6cd7263c6ce88fa1855dfd0a760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_7cc566c991e9fd65aa8c57e3f2c61a90c2e50e71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_562673711af4416ebec17fbd7626df32aff35371.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_cdbab8c3e61d887eef35d2583edcf491d1add04a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_f5682c3478d2435f3d5a9600c6bbe0ae98fc8822.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_943cf545174e3f19e269e7b4818f2f69660924b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_e25f9cde722a7ab14763b8152405940d0227451c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_fa1f8b711370865ca52dffd72f8608fe2abcfc6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_08c8e33f365e8e8ae3f99cb20555d884c38fea86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_805e5b4ae2a89933a64ea1b25f604cd14935ef59.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337760/ss_1962768c779f975c33c63e092080a1d4b9048039.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664044256","Action,Adventure,Casual,RPG"

She just said 'James.'' Sagebrush is a short-form first-person narrative adventure about exploring the compound of an apocalyptic Millenialist cult in remote New Mexico years after they collectively took their lives in a mass suicide event. In Sagebrush , you'll investigate the long-abandoned Black Sage Ranch, the former home of Perfect Heaven, an apocalyptic cult formed in the early 1990s under the guiding hand of the prophet Father James. Inspired by Real-World Apocalyptic Cults Based on extensive research into cult groups both famous and obscure, large and small, Sagebrush avoids simplistic motivations and easy answers. The members of the Flock are diverse and complex people with varied needs, hopes, and fears. An Immersive, Lo-Fi 3D World Sagebrush features an evocative low-poly, low-resolution, less-is-more art style that combines retro aesthetics with modern technology, along with a fully-realized soundscape and an original ambient musical score that immerses you in the remote New Mexico desert. A Whole Compound to Explore Black Sage Ranch is yours to wander, from the trailers that housed the cultists, to the halls where they gathered for food and prayer, to the old mines that stretch out below the compound, untouched for nearly a century. Uncover the Real Story Find notes, recordings, and belongings that give insight into the people who lived at Black Sage Ranch. What did they believe? Why did they join? Were they happy? And why did they choose to end it all?

374,"ASCENXION is a 2D shoot 'em up game where you explore the field to progress. We've borrowed elements of Metroidvania style games, in which you unlock new areas with skills and items that you obtain through exploration. Players must overcome puzzles, traps, elite units, boss fights, and other various obstacles while navigating the field. Grow stronger through rewards earned, to uncover the truth of this world. 　 Synopsis One day, humanity became extinct due to an enormous explosion. Not a single entity was left to pass on the reason behind the extinction, nor to remember those who had disappeared. After what seemed an eternity, you have awoken in the midst of traces of a past human civilization. As you wander aimlessly, you encounter various records left behind by humans and beings who assist you. Will you be able to uncover the secret of this world and face the truth? 　 Features Fast-tempo battles with added strategical elements ASCENXION is an action shoot 'em up game, but in order to give the player a combat experience that differs from bullet hell games, we decided to make choices and concentration key gameplay points, instead of simply avoiding enemy bullets and attacking all over the place. There are a variety of strategic elements such as terrain cover, reduced movement speed during basic attacks, and mutual sharing of resources consumed by attack and evasion skills. Also, players must use basic attacks, skills, and items' active effects to defeat enemies. Get items through exploration Players can explore unknown lands to acquire dozens of distinctive items. Items are divided into 'rune stones', which combine weapons and use effects, and general items which provide basic lasting effects and experience bonuses. Elements of Development Important concepts in ASCENXION are 'unleashing potential' and 'skills'. Each aircraft type has four skills, and from the second skill, they will be unlocked upon defeating boss monsters that you encounter during the game. Skills You can only select one of two skills for each stage, but you can change your choice at any time. You need smarts and a good gamer mind to change your skills according to the situation, whether it be the terrain or enemy type! Unleashing Potential ASCENXION has a main character with some great power sealed inside. Of course, this great power can be unleashed. By completing an event that you will inevitably encounter during the game, you can unleash this power, and when this power is unleashed, modifications are made to its skills and overall stats that suit an aircraft of such great power. Each unleashed aircraft has a different play style, so choose the one you like, and keep leveling it up!","“게임 피지컬을 발휘해 적의 탄막 패턴을 피하고 일반 공격과 특수 스킬, 무기 스킬을 적절히 퍼부어 적들과 보스를 제압하는 슈팅 게임으로써의 재미는 확실히 일품이며, 메트로배니아 게임으로써의 완성도 또한 일정 수준 이상을 보여준다. 그만큼 어려운 난이도의 게임이기도 하지만, 슈팅 게임과 메트로배니아 게임을 모두 선호하는 게이머들이라면 상당히 만족스럽게 즐길 수 있는 게임이기도 하다.” Recommended – Kutar'k",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/header.jpg?t=1655723048,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_add4710a82f77b0ee508b489df1602764712e913.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_ec4306e44fc208ffb55c6790d855547e510c32fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_8b75a280f6be31035e4425202c1ac1e85494fe58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_ba3d5067b98559827d37d671c1ec98be17dc36b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_efcaddb998803d0d4fa36428581c81dafde50d24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_5ef94d97e5e999bc0305962523825f3e2d84f859.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_5f4a2bd47f20405c38edd5fb8bebf88d0ad1bc23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_f6012397c7a4de980b013ffe48eef3747904b7f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_e8396fe9274a82643c0d6d008f3c84ea55c4b48c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_095d9bcef7fc2b7d613df6cca6d31c10e28c1cc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_8bf91905f1966076f3514dea6fd83b91305b91a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_3caf9dcb75c38044e36c294f03702e7b1427028d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_a8089554acd5eae5fbb818dd8d4087501ed16359.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048","Action,Adventure,Indie"

381,"Quanero is an experimental VR experience for the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift . Your goal is to figure out what caused a violent incident in a futuristic bar by manipulating the time. You can slow down time, reverse it or bring it to a halt. Explore the scene, unlock the story's branch points and unravel the mystery. There's also an explosion. Quanero was created with Unreal Engine 4 and can be downloaded for free. Background Information The possibility of experiencing stories in virtual reality offers completely new challenges to the art of storytelling. The traditional work of directing and the function of the cameraman have to be reconsidered completely, as the player is able to choose his point of view and position. We have tackled this challenge in our final bachelor project Quanero and even went one step further: in this experience, we also give the player complete control over the time. Thus, it is possible to move forward and backwards in time, to stop it or to view the action in slowmotion from every perspective in the room. We're offering the player a new and extremely immersive experience. The goal of the experience is to find the source of the devastating chain reaction which climaxes in an explosion. Quanero was developed specifically for HTC Vive. VR technology enables you to feel like you're in this futuristic bar, partaking in a brawl or a drug deal and finding yourself in a spectacular explosion with debris raining down on you. This project was created by students from the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg's MultiMediaArt and MultiMediaTechnology degree program. The content was created with several 3D applications and textured with the help of substance painter and designer. Body and facial expressions were acted out by professional actors and digitized with a motion capture system.","“If you are a Sci-Fi fan, especially if you are a Blade Runner fan, then you'll want to try Quanero on the HTC Vive.” 10/10 – VR Circle “There's been a crime in a bar downtown.

393,"An intense, arcade-style, shooter in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions! The Jetboard : Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock. The Enemies : Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too... The Weapons : From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake.

The Bosses : Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? These features make Nowhere Prophet stand out Card-based tactical combat system New procedurally generated maps each game Find loot and recruit followers to build your deck Unlock new content across multiple playthroughs More than 300 cards for you to discover Indian infused electronica soundtrack A roguelike deck-building game Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

You may play solo or with friends to infiltrate, conquer planets and gather resources. The Rawbots universe has a unique set of matter, energy and physics laws. These laws are engineered to serve up fun emergent gameplay that is different every time you play. Everything you would expect from a sandbox game and more. We are taking this to the next level with gameplay that truly emerges beyond imagination and defined contextually by the type of robots you build. On one planet you might experience a first person shooting experience, go into a space battle in 3rd person, and down into an RTS offensive on another planet. An intuitive and streamlined graph system will bestow the power of visual programming into the hands of creative minds. Under the hood, the latest in signal processing, inverse kinematics and PID controllers, will breathe life into your creations. From geeks, to tinkers, to grinders, there is a creation path for everyone. And while you are building and tinkering around, we will also be busy developing story campaigns, random missions, battle tournaments and creating new and impressive bot parts.","“We’ve all wanted to build our own robot fighting machine at some point in our life; usually a lack of university level robotics education tends to get in the way.

The fact that the protheses break down after a short time was not classified, but was mostly overlooked and neglected by the richest part of population. One of the largest factories in this industry, Pjural, stored industrial waste in a properly designated sector D. The waste was stored underground. Many talented people have been extracting, reworking and selling these parts. The first town of Landfill was founded and Sector D began to grow. There, we meet our hero who after many years spent in the sector had ceased to resemble a human. The main character, Amelon, leads the life of a hermit. Everything that he has achieved, he achieved by himself. His house consists of a small junkyard, a charging station, a film projector, a windmill, and a machine that extracts parts from the underground. His day consists of collecting and extracting parts. However, such a large number of bionic prostheses disturbs memory. Every day he remembers less and less. He distances himself from his past and forgets his relatives. Amelon is aware of the danger, so he records a message for himself about where and who he is. The day is coming when he doesn't remember anything.

After an unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for new pants. Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some pants are easy to find.

754,"STORY In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form. Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is commonplace. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing everyday people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive. Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications. Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study. You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company. THE GAME The subject is a sci-fi puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements and visual aesthetics of early 80s sci-fi. You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various testing rooms set out in the experiment and collect items needed to progress through the maze. You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by euthanization.

774,"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem.

802,"Build. Fly. Build. Shoot. Build. In Captain Forever you build spaceships while you are flying them . There's no cumbersome editor. Just blast an enemy ship apart, grab a piece with your mouse, and bolt it to your ship. Done. What's more, everything is physically simulated so ship design has a huge impact on flight characteristics and combat capability. All Three Games. Captain Forever Trilogy includes the games Captain Forever, Captain Successor, and Captain Impostor. Forever is the original, award winning game. It's vanilla. Successor adds tons of new modules and ship types. It's a whole ice-cream shop. Impostor blows the formula apart by allowing you to instantly clone any of the game's enormous, fantastical ships. It's an all in ice-cream shop food fight. Better Than Ever. With its brand new renderer, Trilogy is faster, slicker, and shinier than ever. What's more, the new wing shaped modules massively increase the scope for cool looking ships and thoughtful design.

We will use the feedback from players to shape the direction of the next chapter. We hope that this unique approach will provide an engaging and thought-provoking experience for all participants, as everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the game. You can come up with your own character, your own riddle, put something of your own into the game! Immerse yourself in the mystical atmosphere of an eternal summer evening, with a nostalgic nod to the 80s and 90s Eastern Europe. Our inspiration comes from real objects found in our grandfathers' homes, which we have carefully recreated to transport you back in time. We will curate a selection of player-generated ideas to feature in the upcoming chapter. Moving forward, only paid subscribers will have the opportunity to contribute story influences and suggestions. However, for the first chapter, all those who have purchased it will be able to participate in this exciting creative endeavour by submitting their own photos or items or ideas for consideration. Our indie game was created by just three of us, and we took on the challenge of developing it in two languages. Our goal was to create puzzles that were out-of-the-box and a plot that was strong enough to keep players hooked. The plot is rich with details and hooks, and each player will have their own interpretation of the game. The protagonist of our story receives a letter from an old friend, inviting him to visit. Upon arrival at the familiar apartment, he realizes that everything has changed and time seems to have stopped there. As he explores the space, unable to find his friend, he begins to question whether he truly knows this place. With each new discovery, strange occurrences begin to unfold. This first-person game is set in Eastern Europe at the end of the last century, immersing players in its mysterious atmosphere and evoking nostalgic memories for some. This linear quest is filled with numerous mysteries that each player will interpret differently. After completing the first chapter, we invite every player to fill out a form describing their vision of the game and submitting options for further plots. Get ready for a journey into the unknown!

Every choice you make will contribute to your destiny as well as the land you rule. A small, split-second decision may result in a completely unanticipated event. You have to tend to council's requests, manage your advisers, lead your people and continuously nurture and utilize your lands to prosper while fight against the natural and urban disasters. Take advantage of industrial chains, use your advisers, decide on your investments and build your way to victory. Keep your people happy, your treasury full and your cities secure, because evaluation council will surely grade you for everything you do! But as you develop Hongye, you may notice there is a force working against you and everything is not what it seems to be. You may take a deep dive into the conspiracy and find the truth, for yourself and your people. What will you sacrifice to revive Hongye? Will you be a fearsome leader or respected through love and admiration? The choice and the stage is yours! Earning the right to rule is hard. From valleys and mountains to the desert, different lands demand different approaches. Attributes of the land impacts production, security and commerce provides a unique playing field and experience for each challenge. Cleverly designed challenges around the unique aspects of the land also greatly differ from each other. For example, some lands are abundant in minerals, but soil is barren, limiting food production. Some lands are receiving refugees while others are the frontline of the war. Prepare your resources and gold, and take the challenge on! Only constants in Hongye are you and the land itself. Production yields are different for each season, so when choosing a building plan which determines your agricultural and industrial outputs during the challenges, you should plan ahead. Hone your advisers to provide additional plans for you and, if you can successfully face the challenge, you get to keep some of your blueprints to use them at other sites in Hongye. Four seasons bring different environmental conditions, changes the landscape and potentially can cause natural disasters.

Retain your roster by openly negotiating for it, making deals or winning salary-bidding competitions. Plan your progress with Talent tree and unlock new talents as you develop yourself as the Magistrate. Talents will assist you with disaster and adviser management and ensure the stable development of the towns. Unlock markets, workshops, banks and other special buildings to ensure Hongye's revival.

1079,"Heartbound is a non-traditional role-playing game about a boy, his dog, secrets, and sanity. Follow Lore and Baron on their adventures through time and space. Handle combat through a series of unique mini-games with varying objectives. Change the story through exploration and interaction with the world. A massive series of optional cryptographic puzzles that can be solved as a community. Varying environments with unique pixel art, an inspired soundtrack, and tons of extra socks. That awful feeling when you do something terrible to someone who loves you. More gags than you can shake a stick at. Binder can lend you one of his if you don't bring your own. Advanced sadness. Heartbound does not use the traditional systems of Levels, Experience, or Consumables. Everything is skill-based and combat can change based on your relationships with others or things you have done. Weapons can be found throughout the world and they augment how much damage you deal in certain situations. Every enemy you encounter has unique mini-games that you will not see anywhere else in the game. There are no random battles and a number of encounters are avoidable based on how you progress. Combat never ends in death and defeating someone allows you to see their memories from their perspective. What you do from there is up to you.","“Returning to a game in this style felt like coming home.” IGN “It appears that Heartbound will be a game that'll tug at the heartstrings and more by the time of its release, which, judging by the title, seems just right.” Game Skinny “I really really like it!

You take command of the US Marines and will test your ability to do better than those brave Marines did back in 1945. Realistic battle depiction Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases. In each phase you get to move, support, or attack following a strategy that has to combine enemy lines penetration, HQ communication lines, and overall support for the units that are in heavy contact with the enemy. Units are approximately company-sized. A challenging strategic problem Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle. Armor should be used in a supporting role and not in the front lines otherwise the Japanese will eat them for breakfast. Troops need to rest and not be constantly engaged in combat. Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability. Make the most of your resources Use the support points on units that are likely to be fired upon by the Japanese, especially when moving, to reduce your losses. Keep your units fatigue levels low by resting them from combat as they will become less effective as they keep on fighting.","“Battle for Iwo Jima is an excellent example of the historical depth a simple wargame can have with the right design theory to back it up.

1213,"T-Minus 30 is a fast-paced, single-player city builder where you plan a city and assemble a space fleet to escape a dying Earth. You must scavenge a post-apocalyptic environment to build infrastructure, grow crops, generate power, and build rockets to save as many people as you can. All within 30 minutes of play. You start your new settlement with the intention of turning post-apocalyptic land into working rocketry. So, you start by digging Wells which produce and propagate Water. Then you create Tilled Earth, which receives that Water and becomes Farmland, which in turn produces Food. You can build up your infrastructure to support solar farms and hydroponics labs to stock sleek generational ships that each rescue thousands of evacuees. Or, you can remain low-tech and brute force your population off the Earth by building massive numbers of 1960s era rocketry. And, that's T-Minus 30. A timeboxed city builder that focuses on resource propagation, exploration, and saving as much of humanity as you can before the Earth explodes. Mind you, however you play, you can't save everyone, and people will still end up dead. But that's life. Explore abandoned ruins of a once-bustling civilization. Mine skyscrapers and junkyards to reclaim plastics and metals. Explore procedurally generated landscapes, from small, arid maps with scarce resources to large, forested maps replete with ancient ruins. Create the infrastructure to convey energy, water, and other resources to your ever-expanding base of operations.

Watch out for dangerous creatures that react to your movements and decisions, and cleverly concealed traps that will test your ability to survive. Over six years in the making, FEIST is a gorgeous hand-made adventure unlike anything else, with a cinematic presentation reminiscent of The Dark Crystal or Hedgehog in the Fog, and a tense original soundtrack by Tomek Kolczynski.","“RECOMMENDED: There's a purity of vision in its savage scenarios.” EuroGamer “The most brutal thing about Feist is how desperate its encounters are: they’re protracted, stressful, improvised fights to the death. Feist is remarkably tense for a platformer. The world’s tension is heightened by the music: a quiet, forlorn ambience shrouding the woods of Feist in a supernatural melancholy. There are moments of startling beauty in Feist.” PC Gamer “The look, described as 'a cinematic physical-effects style reminiscent of Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal, or Hedgehog in the Fog,' is brilliant.

It’s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first, but – flawed though it is – I found myself having a lot of fun with it.” Gamezebo “There seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games.

I loved this game from the minute I began playing and it only got better. Many times, TM games become a bit boring but not so with Hard to be a Queen. I loved the very funny dialog that pops up between the scenes. The tasks also kept me involved in the game. When I find a TM game like Royal Life Hard to be a Queen it is a keeper for me. The only thing that would make the game a bit better, IMHO, is if the icons for the inventory were larger. It was difficult for me to see how many resources I had available as the numbers were so tiny, particularly the ones on the side that indicated the bricks or other miscellaneous items I needed to collect in order to move forward. Aside from the small icons, the rest of the game is excellent. I love the graphics and, of course, the dialog that at times had me rolling on the floor. Royal Life Hard to be a Queen is a TM game that will keep me entertained for hours. Kudos to the developer for creating an excellent game that I think is one of the best that I have played this year. Even though Hard to be a Queen is an instant buy for me, please try the demo to see if it is one that you will enjoy as well. Happy gaming!” 5/5 – Big Fish Games Customer “This game was a no brainer for me, even though I'm not very good at the time management games. LOL! I lasted less than five minutes on trial and purchased the game. You definitely have to read the storyline. Besides having Queens', I laughed at the first riddle. Who in their quirky mind would laugh at a PC game? ME!! After the laughing at the conversations and watching men running around while the women watched I felt right at home in my own little world. Noticed I said, 'My own little world'. LOL!

1299,"CLAD in IRON: Philippines 1898 is a Spanish-American War alternate history naval game in which a turned-based wargame and a real-time strategy are combined. Alternate history is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which historical events occur differently. These stories contain 'what if' scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. Historical Events: The first battle between American and Spanish forces was at Manila Bay where U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron defeated a Spanish squadron. The following Dewey's victory, Manila Bay was filled with the eight warships of Germany. The Germans expected the confrontation to end in an American defeat, with the Filipinos revolutionaries capturing Manila and leaving the Philippines ripe for German picking. The main forces of the U.S. Asiatic Squadron, including the mighty cruiser USS Olympia, are forced to guard the Manila Bay from German warships. 'What if' Scenario: The shocking outcome of the Battle of Manila Bay spurred the Spanish government to organize a relief expedition. Warships, troopships and transports arrived from Spain to Iloilo City. Coming new battle between the rising and falling empire! Gameplay Description: Manage your fleet and army, hunt the enemy's fleet, hide your weak squadrons in protected ports until reinforcements arrive, blockade enemy trade routes, amphibious assaults and harbour sieges, struggle for dominance over the seas in turned-based strategic mode - all of these actions are possible in CLAD in IRON: Philippines 1898. The real time tactical battle mode allows you to set up battles and squadron groups with their formations and management using realistic ship models and characteristics as well as advanced ballistics and weapon models. Choose your ships, increase the experience of your crews and send your squadron into the high seas. Command a battle formation and experience the power of iron and steam in a turned-based maritime strategy mode while fighting battles with a tactical real time naval simulation game.

A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level. The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock?

1343,"Turn a scripted steel-cage wrestling match into a real fight in this 250,000-word interactive novel! You've always dreamed of becoming pro wrestling's biggest star...but a wrestler's world is fraught with hardship and betrayal, in and out of the ring. Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success. But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly. This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever. Slammed! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. There's never been a professional wrestling game like this, a game where the outcome of your final match, your choice of opponent, and your relationships affect the ending. When's the last time you played a pro-wrestling RPG with a 'kayfabe' stat?--or where your trash-talking 'promo' ability is as important as your core strength and wrestling technique? Enjoy a 250,000-word personal tale of friendship, competition, and revenge. Develop not only your physical abilities, but a favored wrestling style. Become a heroic face, or a villainous heel--or even turn heel. Turn a scripted match into a real fight--and vice versa. Decide when to keep kayfabe, and when to break it. Play as male or female, gay or straight.","“Another thing I'm really liking about Slammed! is that it doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty, behind-the-scenes world of pro wrestling.” TouchArcade “SLAMMED!

1420,"At the farthest edge of the explored universe, the research ship Xanadu slumbers in orbit around a mysterious planet. Her systems remain active but there has been no message from her crew for months. Now a lone operative has been sent to wake the Xanadu and bring her home to Earth. Spirits of Xanadu is an atmospheric exploration game set aboard a deserted starship in an alternate 1980s. It draws inspiration from classic sci-fi films, novels, and games to create an immersive and highly interactive environment, featuring puzzles and FPS elements in the service of a unique and layered plot. Key Features: Discover the truth Get to know the crew and piece together what happened through fully voiced audiologs in addition to various types of documents and e-mails. Three distinct endings Make a decision based on what you have discovered, and decide the fate of the Xanadu. No hand holding You have one primary objective: Return the Xanadu back to Earth. There are no objective markers, you have no map, and the ship has been sabotaged. You begin your mission with only a flashlight and a message from your superiors back on Earth, the rest you'll have to figure out on your own. Hot robot action with first person shooter combat Evade the ship's security system while battling hostile robots. Fully interactive environment Inspired by the immersive environments of games such as Deus Ex and System Shock 2: Open every drawer, use every computer, and read every document you find. More importantly, you can flush every toilet. Optional 'Peaceful' mode Not a fan of violence against robots? Switch to the Peaceful difficulty setting in the options menu to make the robots passive, allowing you to explore the ship, experience the story, and solve puzzles at your own pace.","“Spirits of Xanadu offers an enriching gameplay experience that lingers on the edge of my thoughts even now. While I feared it would turn out to be just another sci-fi horror adventure, it jumped up and surprised me with meaningful storytelling, interesting mysteries, and three different endings (all of which are extremely impactful, depending on what kind of psychotic person you are).” Johnny Ohm, Gizorama “The game is proof that you don't need Unreal Engine 4 visuals or graphic violence to be scary and immersive, all you need is a character, a ship and the endless void where all your dreams - and all your nightmares - can exist.” Steve Buja, Gamenguide “This is an impressive little horror game because of how heavily it avoids typical horror imagery. Sure, there’s a blood trail marking the path of a [dragged] body, but that’s the only bit of gore in the whole game. Instead, Spirits of Xanadu leans into the surreal and the mystical, like floating kabuki masks and lotus flowers casually placed in a briefcase, all taking place in an alternative futuristic 1983.” Nick Dinicola, PopMatters",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/header.jpg?t=1574623724,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_b79118bfa5fba60b972b3eff91848d580f1faece.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_a005eb6959a4fe4aebe5ca5c8e4b593ad20a042c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_107296fd8f7da020590497e178d10d624287588b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_c9cb6afc156f2709508d957562d204d465599979.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_70e9e3444f861b10343cdc72f9f436a639029392.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312230/ss_163adeefbad523fd27e7dacb1f2c43c32fa0f941.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574623724","Action,Adventure,Indie"

1432,"Welcome to Puzzle Island, a beautiful place where time stands still and there's nowhere you need to go. It's just you, the sand, the palm trees and of course the lovely ocean. But we wouldn't want you to get bored while you're here, so how about some puzzles to solve while the sun sets? In each level of Puzzle Island VR you're given various objects such as crates, buckets, balls or planks. Equipped with some of the most realistic ropes you've ever seen in a game, you'll need to somehow stack those objects to touch the glowing orb. Sounds easy, right? Well it isn't always. Sometimes the wind will blow your boxes away or the force-field prevents you putting that create exactly where you need it and often the solution is more challenging than simply stacking objects. The puzzles will require you to think like an engineer, keep cool like a martial arts grand-master, have a steady hand like a marksman and also think outside of the box like an inventor. Features Beautiful and realistic island : Perfect for presenting the capabilities of VR Super cool rope physics : Swing them and fling them, pretty amazing Family friendly : Show your kids the beach No time limits : Relax, become one with Puzzle Island and take as long as you need to solve the puzzles.

1446,"TinShift is a dynamic first-person shooter arena. We inspired by Quake, UT and Titanfall. It's based on plausible shooting, wall running and sweaty armpits. 10 types of weapons are available. Some are classic, others will have to be used wisely and according to the situation. 1 map for 20 players with palm trees and vertical gameplay. You can climb anywhere. The second class is robots. It's for those who are tired of running around and just want to blow everything around. Return in time is a thing. Due to the excessive dynamics, it is often not possible to immediately respond to a surprise attack or a stray sniper bullet. We understand this and therefore everyone has a second chance - to change the course of events with a rollback 10 seconds back. Chance recharges when you successfully kill an enemy. And for dessert: NOT BATTLE ROYAL. Unexpected, right? We ourselves are tired of crawling across the field for 40 minutes until a bush kills you. We invite you to take part in the Leadership Race. Every man for himself from the start, but to win you become ALONE against EVERYBODY. There is no need to wait for a new match. Dropping by into the server in the middle of the game, you are in the same conditions as the experienced players. After finish, the match will restart automatically. It's non-stop. We play together with you! We are constantly in touch with the players on Discord and make a dream game together.","“The last minute you need to live, regularly pulling out the championship, gives a lot of fun, and the game turns into a perky carnage, where absolutely everyone is chasing you and trying to take over the baton.” IGN “Unlike the battle royale, the Tinshift player can always be reborn in case of death and again rush into the midst of the battle, as was the case in classic shooters.

From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum.

1506,"So What Is Meeple Station? Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies.

1523,"Angels Cove is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a secluded house on a remote island to conduct a paranormal investigation... Environment The game starts off as you crash your boat getting to a remote island. You need to find your equipment and make your way across the island to get to the house exploring other buildings and areas of the island unlocking areas of access along the way. Story Line You've been called to the house to investigate strange disturbances. But the house is abandoned. The closer you get to the truth, the more the activity intensifies. Your role now is to understand the past behind the house and its island home.....or is it? Gameplay In Angels Cove, you are only armed with your investigation equipment. However, you will need to find items to access other areas of the island and the house. Explore every corner to find collectibles and hidden achievements. You won't die in this game. But you will be haunted as your investigation gets closer to the truth.","“Top 10 Halloween Games for 2021 - Devilish Delights: Another first-person haunted house offering, Angels Cove draws heavily on contemporary ghost stories – in fact, your character is a supernatural investigator sent to explain spooky occurrences on a crumbling island estate – ranging from reality shows like Ghost Hunters to the semi-fictional “based on a true story” films like The Conjuring and its many spin-offs. You’ve got your haunted dolls, your remote camera set-up, your tape recorder for picking up “electronic voice phenomena” (ghosts talking to you)…but despite the familiarity fans of today’s found-footage horror might feel, it’s extremely effective: this is perhaps the scariest game on our list, and it creates both an encroaching atmosphere of terror – and several effective jump scares – without resorting to gore and violence.” InfinityWaltz - IndieGameReviewer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/header.jpg?t=1657162994,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_68c9b9214ade1b1692134b23ceaa59082a92000d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_6cfb0a493ebf1eef9adf852f8620727a7bab7321.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_05c8f990695895318222a103705e5db4e84bcb42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_26dfdea91b9d5c0143b0af3617afc22296a7b05c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_f80a8609fce95a8b6f4578766a6e10346d708932.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_fd9539deb4811d55bf1e2f8bc21d8f8b51a214e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_aab6aa957a77e803cbc0146423813aa390467c55.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_c3a02efc99d488cf044ad8b311c756adac655b08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_c3790bf21a6c603f9004fcc702d84706a469e9fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_31db9d16fb46c91455e1aa15222b53571761c00e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1714440/ss_e053cef4082df4b4310fcbbc989fb171686d0099.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657162994","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy"

1584,"Fantastic Contraption is surreal building game for virtual reality. Create life-sized machines as tall as you can reach, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island. Your task is simple: get the squishy purple ball to that goal off in the distance, or above you, or on the other side of that gap. And your tools are elegantly minimalist: spinning wheels and stretchable rods. But the solutions are endless, and there are no right or wrong ones. We've designed this game from the ground up for room-scale VR. Come immerse yourself in a strange skybound archipelago and befriend Neko the photosynthesizing cat. Build contraptions with your own two hands, life sized and as big as horses, right there in front of you. Play with the physics, juggle pieces, throw darts, and feel another world all around you. Features: Challenging puzzles. 50 official levels that range from cakewalk to what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-right-tell-me-this-is-impossible. But guess what, it IS possible. I think. Infinite solutions. Working cars, tanks, catapults, conveyor belts, walking creatures or minimalist structures that use only gravity. Design for elegant simplicity, or build a rattling pile of junk that just barely makes it to the goal. Whatever. Building with your own hands. Movement so simple and natural you'll forget you're holding controllers. Need a wheel? Just pick it up. Want a longer rod? Just grab an end and stretch. It's like playing with children's blocks, except they're bigger than you are. Noble ancestry. Fantastic Contraption is the VR evolution of Colin Northway's 2008 2d browser game, played by millions and still playable for free . But don't be fooled, this new game is WAY different. Full 3d audio and music. Actually, this game has no music. What it does have is musical instruments. Except you have to build them. Well... you'll figure it out. Surreal and beautiful landscape. Hey guy, chill here awhile, why don't you just lie down in the grass and just listen to the sky whales singing? You'll totally forget the dystopian present and the 300 sqft windowless cube you now live in. Who needs sunlight? VR. Neko the toolbox. Yes, your toolbox is alive, and he's kind of a green cat blimp thing powered by pink farts. He doesn't seem to mind when you pull off one of his tails or yank a pin out of his head. They grow back pretty fast, so I guess it's okay... Online sharing. Venture bravely into the dark world-within-a-world to load contraptions made by your friends and also some random people. Marvel at the crazy crap they came up with. Then narrow your eyes and say: I can beat this. I can do better. Level Editor. Make your own puzzles to share with your friends and the community. Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR","“Impressively intuitive and whimsical as f**k.” Kotaku “Fantastic Contraption is a great puzzle game that keeps you thinking about building new machines long after the headset is off.” UploadVR “Fantastic Contraption works the way you'd expect it to if it somehow existed in the real world, and the result is an imaginative game that rewards creativity.

The status of all fifteen workers stationed within the facility is unknown. Valvorta Industries, the controversial energy corporation responsible for the site, must maintain discretion. In response, Valvorta's BoD has elected to dispatch an engineering specialist to assess the situation. The mission is simple: recover information, restore output from the facility and rescue the workers trapped under earth. Traversal through the facility will not be easy. The malfunctioning systems have made the descent near impossible. The high temperatures and the lack of breathable oxygen require the use of a specialized suit. You'll need a sharp eye to find any tools, lifts, documentation, and devices scattered across the facility, and a bright mind to put them to use. Extra attention must be paid to maintaining your suit's battery and air levels if you wish to survive. To make your mission easier, your suit provides a gauge on your current status, a log of any documents you find scattered about, magnetic boot attachments function for situational vertical and upside-down movement, and an instant connection to all terminals requiring rudimentary programming skills. Find whatever information you can and piece together the events leading to the loss in communications. After that, it will be up to you to decide what needs to be done.","“The highlights of the game for me are the a-ha moments.

1591,"SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy. The current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot. See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for an FAQ and links to more information. If you're wondering where the MacOS X port went, see that FAQ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags, but the non-Steam MacOS will continue to work, and I'll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully!","“There has never been a videogame like SpyParty. … SpyParty is as cerebral and personal experience as I’ve ever had with a multiplayer game. … Despite being two years away from completion, the early version I saw still remains one of the most subtle, enjoyable, and surprisingly playful multiplayer games I’ve yet played.” Destructoid “Part of what is so exciting about Spy Party is the stuff that happens around the game. Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it… guilt of all things. I’ve killed thousands — millions? — of enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker’s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized I was wrong. I felt bad.” Kotaku “SpyParty is like nothing else I’ve ever played. … When the laser focuses on you, the tension is intense.

1648,"Absolutely Goode Championship is a game where you can either pilot a fast running marble as it competes, rolling downhill, on countless different tracks or just relax, watch and root for different marble teams competing against each other. Before the consumer electronics revolution, and for millennia, mostly what people had to play with were dice, cards, kites, wheels and marbles. Being, originally, nothing more than rounded pebbles, marbles were able to deliver a lot of fun in hours of playtime. One of the most fun and challenging marbles games was the downhill race, where players would spend hours planning, building and perfecting the race tracks in preparation for rooting for their 'teams', as they rushed downhill using gravity to accelerate towards the finish line. Fast forward to the 21st century and now people of all ages can sit and watch videos of such competitions, in elaborated scenarios, wishing, many times, they could be able to influence the races outcome. Absolutely Goode Championship grants you that wish. Design tracks or let the game do it for you and actively pilot any of 16 beautifully rendered marbles in Quick Races, compete in Championships on 10 different pre-rendered race tracks or just start an idle event and watch teams competing against each other, listening to an engaging theme song.

You must think several moves ahead, inputting the path you wish your clones to take. Once you are ready, you set them on their way, all while you try to progress through the stage.” Bonus Stage “It’s these tricks which Déjà Vu keeps hidden until the right time, which puts an unexpected twist on the puzzling action to keep things fresh and interesting.

1671,"Experience a weird, relentless solar tour in this randomly generated space rogue-lite. Travel from Planet X to Earth while fending off endless waves of attackers. What is the payload? A 'superstar' nuclear bomb. What is the mission? To make her famous! Does it makes sense? Ask the 'scientist' who built that thing! While working on his latest nuclear bomb, Dr. Leopold had a revelation. He wasn't creating a weapon of mass destruction; he was creating a nuclear superstar! Was it the radiation sickness or was Leopold always insane like this? Who knows and who cares? Now you must do his bidding and tour the solar system with Celine, his dear bomb. Who would not be thrilled to host the concert of a nuclear bomb under the control of a clearly insane scientist? Everybody it seems, that's why they are all trying to destroy Leopold's creation. Fight using ranged and melee weapons while blocking attacks with your shield. Manage your bomber and make difficult choices: Do you repair that flaming part, heal that nearly-dead crewman or upgrade your stats? Unlock 9 playable ships. Over 100 different possible crew members, from humans to space bears. 64 different weapons, from puny rifles to nuclear mortars. Over 20 different scientifically inaccurate environments, such as space whale pods and planetary atmospheres. Over 70 enemy types with variations including, Scavengers, Fascist Cats and Pugs from space, Giant insects and Dr. Leopold's experimental rejects. Fight giant bosses on 8 different worlds from Pluto to Earth. Upgrade your ships, modify your famous payload, assemble the perfect crew and buy destructive weapons. Choose your challenge: do you dock at this station and spend 3 minutes dodging an angry Planetoid or do you skip that shop for an easier run through a colorful space aurora? Did that giant insect-shrimp thing at saturn give you a beating before it died in chunks of meat? Just hit that detonate button and blow up your nuclear superstar. That'll show the others. Die a lot, master the game and win a well-deserved victory. Work for the solar system's ultimate genius, Dr. Leopold from Planet X. Saving the universe is common, there is nothing of that sort here, it's just an absurd quest for nuclear celebrity.","“The thing is, difficult or no, FSX is still really good fun. I have a feeling this is the sort of game you could return to week after week, learning its intricacies and formulating the best possible strategy for success. I’d like to see a few changes made, a few quality of life additions, but it’s hard not to recommend a game that’s this much fun and looks this good to boot. I suspect that the brilliantly named developer, Turbo Pelvis 3000, will be one to keep an eye on in the future.” 8/10 – The Indie Game Website “In a market saturated with clones or proposals lacking innovation Fission Superstar X is a sign that when things do well the results are great and checking this for yourself is an opportunity you should not miss.” 8.3/10 – Communidad Xbox “Still, for a game that clearly isn’t taking itself all that seriously, there’s a lot of serious, clever fun to be had here.

1701,"Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe. Not many screw with an Operative captaining a Dreadnaught! Explore a dynamic and evolving galaxy Explore a unique sector of the galaxy in every game, with different 'monsters', ship components, quests, and even races Fight in the galactic war between the various alien races Battle hundreds of different enemy starships Build the coolest and deadliest starship in the galaxy Outfit your ship with thousands of components and crew Adventure with your friends with co-op multiplayer","“While it doesn’t have the flashy, immediate appeal of a conventional Pinata-popper like Diablo, Drox Operative provides the greater gift of a world in which the action part of ARPG has consequences, as does inaction.

1840,"'You are outgunned. You are massively outnumbered. You must win.' These are your orders. Humanity has already fought its war against the machines -- and lost. AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole, the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles, and the AIs have turned their attention outward, away from the galaxy, to alien threats or opportunities unknown. This inattention is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it's too late. You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs, but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores. Go forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down.","'AI War breaks most of the genre’s rules. Which is precisely why it’s incredible… This out-of-the-blue one-man passion project is one of this year’s finest strategy games.' - Alec Meer, PC Gamer UK, November 2009 It’s a balancing act, with your own strength on one side, and the AI’s opinion of you on the other. Piss it off before you’re ready to face it, and you’re going to get squashed. That moment, when you’re finally in a position to turn the tables, is about as glorious as gaming gets. - Phill Cameron, Eurogamer, February 2011 I think I’ve stumbled across this year’s Really New Thing. There’s a lot of 2009 to go, but I’ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively. And I’m hoping it’ll be the Next Big Thing, because it’s big, different, entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS. - Tom Chick, Crispy Gamer, August 2009 Having played this title at two distinct points in its life cycle what really stands out is the incredible dedication of Arcen Games in keeping on top of how the game evolves and expands. Even though a great many features have been added and tweaked and refined, it was possible for me to drop back into AI War after more than a year away and not find it to be a confusing mish-mash of feature overload. The post-release support is, quite honestly, the best I’ve seen for any game. - Peter Parrish, IncGamers, February 2011 AI War is, quite simply, the best experience you could have with co-op or single-player real-time strategy in this or any year. It combines grand strategy with emergent AI to form an excellent game perfect for parties and multiplayer. It is easily worth double the price that the developer is selling it at, and anyone with any affinity or taste for strategy games should not miss it. It may be daunting at first, but an excellent tutorial and amazing gameplay mechanics alleviate this into a game that almost anyone can - and should - play. - James Murff, Big Download, November 2009",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/header.jpg?t=1641758804,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_98bd1b6f9edaf09b0b7c683300557a2efc52f152.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_ccf43ceb8aaa890ef225688e1fc2b6c13fd193f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_36b0da3b643aa5143ff584e8eb76e511bd7bac92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_f3b64ed9b1df34522a357f3c3b3496d5a397c235.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_a1f1fb4c88288e133425b3cd824b23608bc0adc5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_05745788af553dd5ab197d487caf88ad4baafa94.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_9a2a17dd21df8cb7afa3f438b2d81d9e1573954e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_2ccb0dff4c40eae6968f03cdb39d38e821e480dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_0fef3175a838e04a8a6e79a4d897b57eecd60c95.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_bce79250e1fb0b7e2cca4ab7ce11f96e975ae5c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_df9a2df4a27d89fefb94b1d9997e90f3ab03482e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_d2d599646ad9504044d187893c57830ebe670560.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_cd7a00be7ce5995d8c62ab542a4653d3e3a2f5aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_a14d9bb353df99758feb8374f3e06f800cee09e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/ss_bd87d6c1d4c14e0445f618798a843dbc8ed2c451.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641758804","Indie,Strategy"

1907,"Land Doctrine is a 3D sandbox strategy game. You can design tanks, manage research, equip infantry, set up infantry training, optimize production and build combined arms battalions to crush your enemies. You have complete freedom to customize your army and you will need both superior designing and logistical skills as well as masterful tactics to outsmart your opponents and triumph on the battlefield. The combat system is based on measuring anti-tank firepower against armor and anti-personnel firepower against infantry cover while the combat distance gradually decreases during the battle. The terrain affects the starting distance of engagement, cover and tank maneuverability. Side, rear or top armor is exposed to enemy fire when tanks are fighting in complex environments, like woods, urban areas or marshland. It is an accurate and clever yet immediate system designed around the idea of optimizing your divisions. Therefore, research is an important part of the game. You can develop new tank engines, suspension, guns and infantry weapons or improve industrial efficiency and training methods. You can design a new tank, set up a production line to produce it and increase the production capacity by capturing enemy cities. Proper training is essential for victory. Inadequate training will cause increased casualties, while good training will generate combat bonuses. The training capacity is also limited: optimize carefully. You can manage infantry equipment at the platoon level. Select small arms and heavy weapons to provide the necessary firepower, then unleash it to see your enemies vanquished! Main features: - Randomly generated maps - More than 2100 possible tank designs - Tech tree with 99 research projects - Customizable infantry equipment with 23 infantry weapons - Custom training doctrines","“For just $5 it’s a damned good deal” 8/10 – The Strategy Gamer “The cost of entry is minimal, and though far be it for me to assess value for money, Land Doctrine is cheap enough to warrant satisfying curiosity.” Wargamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/header.jpg?t=1574261137,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_1b54cee2971b285be8d2a186088f9ab876ab88d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a08999934e066fa9fd3380af2ead93bc786ab7c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a0e8f8f832297e086a979ae26eb31b758b92ef04.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bde2ba1ff5101569fe3d43e852dc66f5a70db9db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_ed2b67833bd645c94a0127063714a269a486637d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bc299eaaa80f8d526c0fabbcba6bdeb2f1f04f60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_675050d42ddb62b9ca4977033fa3a3a1d6be06ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_6248933a509d548c71e9b73ab2d76ed19aa250d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_24c5c6b8d04afc6f302997c6280720055332ab52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_28591a67bee4874f67838b9c9d32327557e525d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_b2b74305e5ab375887c94c4f1ffccd8eaa1646ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f26030f74c37dfa9a44b8745bc0f69190ba81502.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_7f811deb7bbce013e59675c590e447980d3143b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_88faa81decdf1ff0c9ec926de357aff696c46462.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_c79a405a96f6b95187e0eaaef0896f3d9618f314.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_680c111b2f8eebb9665a0dcd9c0a4b3b6759225a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_5c7964dcbb89627afb3dd3759852587f8d5c3894.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_fa99b807ad54d7d1d163205511744ba9d28c8b9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_71b95b026d47c881c50d9912112c3d52eb50d4ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a8053b9d8f531163d4f83171937845abe693229b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_8c6bc33c52b89bc70a450ace6b84100a486b2291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f4b87415138d42efa681167d6107b13a16089f08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_e828f61c18eacc82873731dfa2a8e8ce72aa9950.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137","Indie,Strategy"

The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it.
