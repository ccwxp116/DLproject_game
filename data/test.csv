20,"The Space Between is a surreal short narrative experience in three acts about the walls we build for us. The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other, they visit the theater's building site. While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about closeness and separation begins. The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience, that should be played in one sitting.","“The Space Between is deliriously uneasy in its final moments, thanks, in large part, to a skin-crawlingly stellar score.” Wireframe “The Space Between's Martin is afraid of intimacy, which is a lot like being terrified of death. Fearing intimacy is almost always about fearing loss. (...)

35,"A Guidebook of Babel is a story-adventure game based on the butterfly effect. It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase! You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel! If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel! From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures! You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force! Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation! Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook. It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain! The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation. Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!","“A Guidebook Of Babel seems to be fanciful and open-minded, but the gameplay is quite mature and the plot is practical and interesting enough. Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, 'Babel' obviously handles both the 'storytelling' and 'puzzle solving' parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then 'A Guidebook Of Babel' is definitely worth watching.” 8.2 – Gamersky “Due to the game's dynamic and fluid design, the surprises of A Guidebook Of Babel will always be endless - every time you think the previous level is foolproof, the next level will immediately break your illusion, telling you that you need to observe carefully, and the story is far less simple than you think. Reverse, reverse and reverse, you can never guess where the story is going, and even if the player has the perspective of God, it will be like being in a mountain, but not seeing the mountain.” 3DM “These things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops. It was also after reading the whole story that I realized that A Guidebook Of Babel is not just a story about a book and a ship, but also a story about the boat maker.” 游研社",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/header.jpg?t=1691389011,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_3f1d7b20597e608191747fd976d7087a8d791a11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_959b248bcbd8774b5ad0097dd1e8bf70af563e0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_9526dcdf81461eb05938951a983c6e969a238d23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5a1d9100408c22aa29d9eaaa9f40aba32cecbd86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5e9e3afec130dc8523b89ec2ef7d6f2745b13e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ed6e7aa76010e68f17e792bcfd98f50f96150c3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_29d12518ad31e00e5a93d1173d0142fb834393f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7faef5ff0d0ea38a04595558cfb38ca35d25f8de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_10f361c2988ce772846f56981d2094f3f81bf96c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7212d5aaf311c52643743a490527794caf969ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_d5bf1c2127b82ca45d1f81dd6ea58fb9d3ebe364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ef320cad58168822bbaec341baae49e587155632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_1f4b4db9b38177f3f6a4b7bbc7ba742f757dba87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_efbe3f7ccf39d48306082c4d212ff285b8dca582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011","Adventure,Indie"

Strategies must be divined with care, and constantly modified to ride the chaotic rapids of the thousands of interactive elements in this opus of creative genius. Perhaps. Or it could just be a damn fine game.” 95 – Amiga Format “Colonization offers hours and hours of entertainment. I played it for over a week to write this review and it commanded my total concentration all the time to play it once through. Because the game can be very different every time you play it, this means that Colonization is the sort of game you could play for ever.” 93 – Amiga Power “'Go and make a world', they said. 'Do it by Wednesday night', they said. 'And bring us back some chips'. Colonization is a fairly simple idea in theory but, thankfully, much more involved once you get going.

On your adventure, you will find common, rare and legendary cards. Don't forget: You will always need your physical cards to cast spells in Malkyrs. Evolution Because Malkyrs is both physical and digital, each card can be traded like with a traditional card game.

Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations. Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world. Key Features: Take on the Gorg in more than 40 challenging levels of revolutionary tower defense action. Satellites in orbit replace the towers and grid layout used in other tower defense games. Move your satellites around their orbits to create the best defense for each wave. Experience a thrilling story inspired by the classic sci-fi films of the 1950s.

Also, players must use basic attacks, skills, and items' active effects to defeat enemies. Get items through exploration Players can explore unknown lands to acquire dozens of distinctive items. Items are divided into 'rune stones', which combine weapons and use effects, and general items which provide basic lasting effects and experience bonuses.

Each aircraft type has four skills, and from the second skill, they will be unlocked upon defeating boss monsters that you encounter during the game. Skills You can only select one of two skills for each stage, but you can change your choice at any time. You need smarts and a good gamer mind to change your skills according to the situation, whether it be the terrain or enemy type! Unleashing Potential ASCENXION has a main character with some great power sealed inside. Of course, this great power can be unleashed. By completing an event that you will inevitably encounter during the game, you can unleash this power, and when this power is unleashed, modifications are made to its skills and overall stats that suit an aircraft of such great power.

414,"Ted by Dawn is a humor laden throwback to classic action platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid. The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. There are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success. On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.","“Step aside Dead Rising, for Ted By Dawn is the new zombie flick in town. It combines side-scrolling platform style movement with undead slaying action, and it’s hilarious. Basically, you’ve got to fight the undead, while dodging giant razor baldes and/or fire and work your way towards bosses. It sounds unplayable, I know, but you’ll be relieved to hear that you are given a chainsaw, and a motorcycle at points. I can imagine those bits aren’t so hard. The most annoying parts aren’t the deaths form zombies or giant bosses though, it’s the unexpected deaths from sneakily placed barbed logs.

422,"What is Math Classroom Challenge? Math Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In the game the player never loses. There is simply a parameterizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much. Math Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.","“Math Classroom Challenge is a excellent (iOS) app for learning basic Math skills (i.e. additions, subtraction, etc.).” Apps Gadget “Math Street Challenge, the augmented version of Math Classroom Challenge” Arbrettspiele",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/header.jpg?t=1621066677,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dc61bb8254149c4b3a93948018d4d016cc9ed234.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bedf34ae3608b35f65e2f41e1e658b9694a7252b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dfdabd155bb40b7843e2ce2de12eddedfb7f2dcd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_cdc7b2a032590480dca5375b8632e676fa2b8fec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6c9a04ffec68682ad3c5733530e7193de33a7412.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bb7c433f20432b5cffe78e7742bf348af72a65c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_070f3c83c3531131781fb8208a179db3dd64a490.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_e355a1755711b64df1a4aa734e2f50ee19837774.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_366170220ffbf8f42110bb33c9ae205f44571680.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6e2d26827ad6aeecc8831833b1f723d70b68639b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_71c973c3a9e52ce8ed02bc9b16987467acf56979.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_f965ece43d8cea8fb9e012e1ee63e70e73112631.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_33ff08bfa379b2a1dcf451d461d90512290b0cbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_15029f5d78fc6619ae1eef55012e63a267aa554c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_9e052ffb0510615a5f00452ab6874175e0558eb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_94baa09916a4c6dd57c730d3efceb1d6f0f84fed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_04072a18613c3bdc17f00b9172bcc0edd77011b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677","Casual,Indie"

Experience this fusion of East and West, old and new, in a game meant to surpass Stegosoft Games' previous work in every way! STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total.

Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart. So did the people. They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too worn by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven successful. The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable.

431,"Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator. Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask. The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper. Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia. Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort. All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health. Always contact a specialist!","“Plague M.

This simulation focuses on stunning architectural spaces and texture transitions. The perfect break from all those action packed games out there. Warning : This game purposely has no saving system. The experience should be done in one walk-through. Take your time. Close the curtains and use headphones. Gameplay The game starts with a 10 minute intro. After the intro you are given control and able to start moving around in the environment. Take your time in exploring the various spaces and music.,"“It’s a work which seems intimately concerned with the fragility of the self in relation to the other: tensions between the two permeate every surface of the game’s inhuman and often uncomfortably alien spaces, and always, there is the sense that at any moment, everything is on the verge of folding in on itself — less an act of momentous collapse than a slow but certain erasure through erosion.” Spencer Yan - Medium “...a fulfilling experience that does something to move the chains for video games in a general sense. It’s a game that got me thinking about hardness and softness, opaqueness and transparency, accessibility and total obtuseness.” Cameron Kunzelman - Waypoint “Fugue in Void is a great game and a great representative of its genre, so if you like the genre, you will also like the game.” MASKINKULTUR",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/header.jpg?t=1648476239,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_77e0026c81e7ba58c30d12a644f32dfb0c370f0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_fdae867ec7d5a681eeb152fadfc9f306819a51f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_3c991d5f2509edb76278e3b058b92e9417a04d91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_21045db629d58e899bea81a7853029d8a112e958.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_46254458cb98b1eb9460e8b3d9d0ac8bed450242.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239","Casual,Indie,Simulation"

Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel. And it cannot possibly go wrong. In theory. Seconds into its maiden voyage it crashes into hyperspace, vanishes... and collides with your house. Bewildered, you find your way aboard, and just as you are gazing at its awe-inspiring interior, the ship takes off again and heads deep into space. You are stranded. But you are not alone... The ship is inhabited by a crew of malfunctioning robots and a semi-deranged parrot. You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters-Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortilian Bantoburn O'Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot. Talk to them, interrogate them. Give them orders. They will listen to you, answer you and, if they happen to feel like it, obey you. Sometimes. To begin with you are a third-class passenger, and you quickly find yourself in the grip of one of the most powerful forces known to man-the desire for a free upgrade. As you move up to second and, at last, to first class, more and more of the ship becomes accessible to you, and more and more of its mysteries are revealed. What has happened here? What terrible events occurred the night before the launch? Who is the mysterious Titania whose brooding statues dominate the ship? Can you solve a series of increasingly bizarre and surreal puzzles., unlock the central mystery and return to Earth before the parrot drives you finally and irrevocably mad?

531,"FIREWORKS MANIA is an explosive simulator game where you can play around with fireworks. In various low-poly environments you can go nuts with all the fireworks you want. Eventhough the game is created to be a casual game where players just have fun for a short while, the game can easily entertain creative players for hours, as they setup a firework show or explore the environments in the hunt for things to blow up. Not two play-sessions are the same, as the game is heavily physics based, resulting a different outcome every time.

560,"Triple Town is an award-winning original puzzle game in which you try to grow the greatest possible city. The larger the city you build, the more points you score. You build your city by matching three or more game-pieces: combine three grasses to make a bush, three bushes to make a tree... until you've filled the board with houses, cathedrals and castles. Along the way, you'll have to outwit giant bears who will try to block your progress. How large can you grow your dream city before the board fills and the game ends? This is the ultimate hardcore version of Triple Town. There are no in-app purchases of any kind in the game. There is no DLC.

774,"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.","“A small but perfectly formed puzzle game about building tiny cities on even tinier boards that keeps you coming back for more” Rock, Paper and Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/header.jpg?t=1700728966,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_105fb55657cb3afe319b0b897bec433ce1d1253f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_ae1b4330e539d3571909fdb467c8c09d3ffd098a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4dad8497edbbbd4f93c9a15bc9a02870ec2b277f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_f0119350752c29572124a569ff5abecc33e7b4c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fd188b47ed458f3870cf33b6728455efaa2d4353.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b2ab251ed4b3110114febafd7c9d1b2b028a7dfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4ee3c1d8a6689cb14b6d35f6aa1a039e2dc14423.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b37b85ff27fe5d0452d192618ea82544326c2e77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_72d4f99b77bb64acdb2f257ef6283a6c2a3b8e9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_288827feb003654057ac1ab3e7c80ab22ed8d299.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_e8bb0fdf7a761e4ef72b0fd5cc15ad8d2a8aabc0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b95734f5bc5ccb3bc37f831df01ffcacc86e782d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_48317c0c289aad73ac7b0a328cbe813a037ef38c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5531a761b3d21bd89c20273f296b8a42ba3e467b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5a6f818ee450d3dadf10bfd29811d18fd7a38a6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fb8b7cbd569da3d0cf48a879a421404d09d2b30d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_a65ff231a970f0dade53d4c87ce1d559ebc5ac12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_d8383fdd037bf81ab0f0f369a31a9670fc3c8b97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_8a18e68b7e789ed112720df5089a67859cff5add.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_532f4630e3b5bacd4309f35ab52b34338b7a3b89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_989e8572b7894373d4d1f1fa2661870a1ad83f68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966",Strategy

The surviving angels and demons gather at the city they believe to be their final chance at salvation: the floating purgatory of 'Tokyo Babel'. Joined by humans, they embark on a pilgrimage across the seven layers of Babel, hoping to ascend Jacob's Ladder in an effort to re-open the gates of Heaven. Their journey would be an atonement toward the heavens. And yet, their plans fall into ruin as a group of pilgrims - their minds consumed by madness - set out to lord over the numerous layers of Tokyo Babel with the intention to wreak complete and utter havoc atop the floating purgatory. Amidst this neverending impasse, a lone youth is saved from the ruins of his devastated world - Tendou Setsuna, a man denied human treatment since birth. Joining his savior, Lilith - known as the Witch of the Night, he begins his journey across Tokyo Babel... ...yearning for an answer to a single question: Why he still possesses the will to keep on living.","“This is a full priced release from MangaGamer, at $34.95, and in my opinion, it is definitely deserving of the premium.

Those who refused were exiled to the island of Fleece, to live unhindered, yet disconnected from the rest of the 'enlightened' world. By 2030 all the Earth was claimed.

As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.

They need your guidance to survive the events foretold by the Prophecy, so make sure your Pips work hard! Dotage has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games. Build your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources. Take your time and think carefully before passing the turn! The memories of the Elder are unclear, so each run will be different, with new buildings to discover. Play with more than 200 buildings, 30 professions, and 70 resources. As you play, the memories of the Elder will come back, unlocking new game mechanics and content, such as new ailments, the mysterious VIPs, and new Elders! Each turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village. From poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse? In addition to each run being different, the game has multiple difficulty levels, so pick the one that suits your playstyle. Enjoy a relaxed turn-based town builder with its cozy graphics, or prove your mastery of the prophecy with the increasingly difficult mastery levels!

1028,"KING MAN! Retro KING MAN! Super KING MAN! Three classics from the past are celebrating a glorious return, bringing you all new features, modern tweaks and the soul of the late 80s and early 90s in one funny package! KING MAN Released back in 1988, KING MAN quickly became a favorite among 8-bit gamers, due to its silly humor, catchy music and clever level design. Paving the way for future installments, this single screen puzzle platformer impressed with its high quality graphics and mind-twisting levels. Retro KING MAN Released in 1990, Retro KING MAN changed the gameplay quite a bit, as players could explore large maps to find upgrades for the KING MAN. Without knowing it at that time, this game featured many ideas that would become a staple of metroidvania and platformer gamedesign in the years to come. Super KING MAN Released in 1992, Super KING MAN brought the titular hero to a new generation of fans, with even sillier humor and over the top voice samples. The game was groundbreaking for its full-screen pixelation effects, the use of widescreen and iconic voice acting. Rounding out this spectacular package is a documentary about the full history of the series, how it started and how it all fell apart. Experience and enjoy these wonderful classics from an era that never was for the first time since their original release and dive into the world of the KING MAN - metaphorically, of course. ------------------------------- Controller Information: This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads. However, due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard.

1044,"Survive the zombie apocalypse with turn-based combat and permanent death! Manage survivors, go on dangerous scavenging runs, build alliances, craft equipment, make difficult story-influencing decisions, defend your camp against undead hordes and experience non-linear rogue-lite elements. An innovative Indie Survival-RPG! Just after the zombie outbreak you were fortunate enough to join a group of survivors and hole up in their camp. But that doesn't set you out of danger! Food supplies are running low, injured survivors must be tended to and materials need to be scavenged to keep the camp intact. The zombie threat increases steadily and gangs of hostile survivors keep you on the defensive. Every survivor should be protected because you'll need all hands on deck to defend against the dangers of the apocalypse. Scavenge supplies in zombie-infested areas, craft survival gear and buy and sell equipment to keep yourself and your camp members alive long enough to learn the skills necessary for long-term survival. The combat system has its roots in classic role-playing games. You can fight strategically, learn to utilize various weapon types and use a range of bombs or traps. Should you fail to survive the apocalypse, you can purchase upgrades with medals earned in previous playthroughs to give your new character an edge to start with. Unlocked pre-apocalypse professions of your character allow you to specialize in various jobs. Each new playthrough offers different random missions and survivors to meet. A praised feature of Dead Age is its non-linear story with real in-game consequences. Decisions you make in conflict situations affect the story's future. You can choose to be a hero and save more survivors, or let them die to stock up on supplies. You can build romance relationships with other survivors or start rivalries that may have disastrous chain reactions. Daily events offer new dangers and situations in which you must make choices that affect the survival chances of your camp. Live long enough, and you'll have a chance to unlock one of the game's six possible endings.",“Dead Age is a surprising and fresh Survival RPG that finally does something different - and amazingly good.” One4U “Dead Age is a terrific genre mix” Games-Mag “Dead Age is a must have for any RPG fan who has always hoped for a post-apocalyptic theme” 7/10 – OPNOOBS,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/header.jpg?t=1649421941,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_60d4fdaa78dc45ab78eb7d6d41a27435d5d8d527.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_4fbbac55b51e5a1a947ff44e2a745d18a45f7910.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_b0816cb3d9c59c3e2c7200e81695c0c1644092fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_47600d5bad1d75f39bcdfed34bac469d25a9ffff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_cf33c179616f84cb1da4468d93f65205ba68e156.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_3fcc96b02b2cdb60e26312de2a7952168646f189.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_60b625466e908308984fa22110a09126680b65a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_0896cb12bdd356981e57b5500614779495d987b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy"

Episodes Each Episode is considered to be a stand-alone experience. Any future Episodes will expand upon Lethe's lore and backstory, but not necessarily the same protagonist's story. Story Crushed under the debts of his recently deceased step-father, Robert Dawn, a journalist with an unremarkable career, decides to hunt down his origins. Everything points to a quiet mining settlement. Shortly after his arrival, Robert comes into contact with an unknown substance and develops psychokinetic abilities that feed on his life energy. As tension rises, he is faced with another, even darker threat, quickly turning the trip into a terrifying battle for survival. Features Stealth Gameplay: Run or hide to survive. Psychokinesis: Manipulate the environment and use it in your aid. But be careful! Your newly gained abilities can only affect inorganic objects.

As a relatively inexperienced hacker, you get the chance to perform tasks for well-known organizations. If you manage to complete these tasks, your reputation will increase and you will be trusted, while you will be rewarded. However, pay close attention to who hires you. The tasks will not be without danger. It is rumored that especially at midnight strange shadows move through the office buildings. According to reports, strange figures roam around various companies from midnight onwards. We're not sure what exactly is meant by these figures, but be on the lookout for danger in any case. Try to leave as few traces as possible, complete your task and escape. You can break into the companies with up to three more companions and distribute the tasks to grab even bigger rewards. However, keep in mind that more thieves means more attention. After receiving a job, you will have to break into a company. Depending on the job, you'll have a variety of tasks. Usually, you'll have to connect to computers in the company to steal data that is relevant for your client. At the same time, there will be some important documents and objects lying around in the company that you can take and steal to increase your loot. Black Hats The Black Hats are an organization that exploits every weakness in the system to get to their goal. They don't care about losses and use shady methods to reach their goal almost every time. They will use any means to get their prey. Satoshi Satoshi is an organization that does everything for money. No matter if companies and people have to be attacked or protected. As long as they end up being richly rewarded for their work, any means is fine with them. Accordingly, they only go for the jobs that are the most lucrative for them. Shadow Nobody really knows who or what is behind the Shadow organization.

18,"A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration. Explore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters. There are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened. You will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. The game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.","“If you’re looking for an experience with a unique setting and some very uncommon enemy types, One Little Serf’s debut project will be right up your valley.” GamingPurists",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/header.jpg?t=1583924464,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_c09643df67f116b5a1e99f6152024779bb8c2c1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_0c9623ab4f869387efe8c8ad242625486b79dbd9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_837e2acda17018ba62a45cc4b83f6c52952df05e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_de18bfb7f163c3610d19fef200585a262ddb3922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1213660/ss_e6fb3f65cca04134c3b7935ff40ed3e99fcfe61a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583924464",RPG

30,"Are ghosts real? You are on your first solo ghost hunting case, under the watchful instructions of Bear and Jen from the O.P.G paranormal team. Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views.

35,"A Guidebook of Babel is a story-adventure game based on the butterfly effect. It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase! You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel! If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel! From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures! You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force! Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation! Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook. It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain! The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation. Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!","“A Guidebook Of Babel seems to be fanciful and open-minded, but the gameplay is quite mature and the plot is practical and interesting enough. Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, 'Babel' obviously handles both the 'storytelling' and 'puzzle solving' parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then 'A Guidebook Of Babel' is definitely worth watching.” 8.2 – Gamersky “Due to the game's dynamic and fluid design, the surprises of A Guidebook Of Babel will always be endless - every time you think the previous level is foolproof, the next level will immediately break your illusion, telling you that you need to observe carefully, and the story is far less simple than you think. Reverse, reverse and reverse, you can never guess where the story is going, and even if the player has the perspective of God, it will be like being in a mountain, but not seeing the mountain.” 3DM “These things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops. It was also after reading the whole story that I realized that A Guidebook Of Babel is not just a story about a book and a ship, but also a story about the boat maker.” 游研社",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/header.jpg?t=1691389011,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_3f1d7b20597e608191747fd976d7087a8d791a11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_959b248bcbd8774b5ad0097dd1e8bf70af563e0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_9526dcdf81461eb05938951a983c6e969a238d23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5a1d9100408c22aa29d9eaaa9f40aba32cecbd86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5e9e3afec130dc8523b89ec2ef7d6f2745b13e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ed6e7aa76010e68f17e792bcfd98f50f96150c3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_29d12518ad31e00e5a93d1173d0142fb834393f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7faef5ff0d0ea38a04595558cfb38ca35d25f8de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_10f361c2988ce772846f56981d2094f3f81bf96c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7212d5aaf311c52643743a490527794caf969ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_d5bf1c2127b82ca45d1f81dd6ea58fb9d3ebe364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ef320cad58168822bbaec341baae49e587155632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_1f4b4db9b38177f3f6a4b7bbc7ba742f757dba87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_efbe3f7ccf39d48306082c4d212ff285b8dca582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011","Adventure,Indie"

64,"2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism. The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells. Because of this, a special unit was formed by mercenaries who opposed human experimentation. One of the major terrorist groups created a secret base in the jungle and started the project 'Confluence', combining plant cells with human cells. The group of scientists that worked on this experimental process also raised an army of soulless bio-soldiers to guard the project. But during the final experiment, 'Confluence' went out of control and began taking over its surroundings. You, as one of the best mercenaries, will have to stop the project in the only way possible: break into its epicenter and blast it to smithereens! The game takes its roots from classic first-person shooters, a series of games such as Wolfenstein 3D, Spear Of Destiny, Operation Bodycount, Blake Stone and many others. The color palette is taken from Operation Bodycount, while the game uses a unique graphical style, approximately similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

84,"VRQB is the definitive arcade VR football experience. You are the quarterback, driving down the field while racking up as many points as possible. Experience the excitement of classic arcade football from the quarterback's perspective! Players can choose from five different footballs that each offer their own unique play style. VRQB currently features three game modes with three different difficulty levels: Classic , Two Minute Drill , and Scramble . Classic In Classic mode, the player drives down the field by hitting groups of three targets spread out across the field. Clearing each set of targets gives the player a first down, enabling the player to move down the field. The player tries to reach the end zone while increasing their multiplier by hitting consecutive targets. Two Minute Drill In the Two Minute Drill, the player has two minutes to score as many points as possible. The player has the option of hitting three different targets, moving to the location of the target hit. Players must weigh hitting the closer, reliable targets to build up a streak multiplier, or airing it down the field and going for the big gain. Scramble In Scramble mode, the player dodges the VRQB tackling dummies while trying to score as many touchdowns as possible.

You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data. To get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.

345,"Welcome to The Lonely Gorilla store page! This is a animal survival game in the tropical African rain forests and grasslands. A living, breathing environment. Advanced AI simulating animal behaviour. Full climate and weather system. What do you do in the game? Explore Rain-forests, grasslands and mountain ranges. Role play as a wild silver-back Gorilla separated from his troop. You must survive the harsh environment finding food, water and shelter. The ultimate goal is to be reunited with your troop, then protect them against predators and the environment. Can you regain their bonding after the separation? As the alpha male only you can keep the troop together and have the right to mate with the females to produce offspring. If bonding is not high this will not occur, and can even lead to challenges from rival males for troop leader status. As food resources dwindle, you must lead your troop to new areas while keeping them safe. How long can you survive? The game is an indie experience from a small team with a focus on the environment and wildlife. We want to give you a true feeling of this amazing, vastly unexplored area of our planet. Highly detailed environments. Full day night cycle and accurate climate system. Plant growth system. Danger from poachers. Threat from predators and rivals. We hope you enjoy exploring the beauty of the grasslands, rivers, and rain-forests of Africa. Authentically crafted terrain, vegetation and animals.

396,"Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare is set in a chaos filled world occupied by battling factions, bandits and warlords who seek to rule the world. The game is about your career as a faction leader: Start with minimal assets, you need to make money, build an army, wage wars against other factions and eliminate your rival forces with thoughtful strategies and fine marksmanship and eventually conquer the world. The game provides a completely different shooter experience which strikes a balance between intense first-person action and general strategy . The game's innovative combat system blends tactical FPS with real-time strategy, allowing you to command an army, plan for tactics in the God view, while immersing in the intense firefight as a foot soldier, in the first-person perspective. Features: FPS meets Sandbox Strategy Game Start your career with almost nothing, you must make money, recruit soldiers, loot villages, fight bandits, attack territories and dominate the world. The game is a combination of challenging action and a wider strategic theater. Shooter and Real-Time Strategy Experience the unique combat system which blends real-time strategy with tactical first-person shooter. You are expected to strategically plan the movements and tactics of multiple squads in addition to having to be an eagle-eyed sharpshooter and possessing catlike reactions. Realistic Combat Simulation The game is about realism. Killing 100 enemies with only a pistol is not possible. You will be challenged by highly intelligent AI that is capable of advanced tactical maneuvers such as flanking, surrounding and even fake retreating, almost like what you would experience in real combat. Only carefully planned tactics, equipment, and cooperation between squads can bring you victory. Are you up to the challenge? High Re-playability The random nature of starting points, enemy AI and objectives will make every battle feel different and challenging. There is no linear gameplay: You have the freedom to decide how to progress in the game, who to fight, what equipment and squads to use and how to dominate the world.

430,"SUMMARY Here, you will be challenged, hurt, and angered... For this, I pity you. I created this game not for you to win but for you to fail. The blockchain doesn't care about your saved file. It doesn't care whether you want to adjust your sensitivity or if you can't 'figure it out'. This game exists simply because it can. I am here to design a game that will break you, not out of spite, but because I am The Dev, and I can. If you beat this game, you are a true dev with honor. Good luck. GAMEPLAY 'The Dev: Enter The Blockchain' is a brutally punishing and annoying third-person 3D platforming game centered around the character, The Dev. In this game, you will play through multiple levels, each with its unique puzzles and challenges. From an arcade shooter level to a 3D platformer level, you'll experience the trials The Dev faces when entering the blockchain. This game unfolds within the photo-realistic, impeccably coded world of The Dev. Witness the inner workings of the blockchain, traverse the trailer park in 3D, and bask in the pure, unadulterated bliss of Dev Island. Your objective: progress through the levels to ultimately reunite with your most treasured possession. Levels you'll encounter include Dev Island, Ponzi Park, and even the blockchain itself. The clock is ticking. KEY FEATURES Enriched single-player narrative driven campaign Limited Settings - Keybindings, audio levels, mouse sensitivity... Adjust none of it. My game is perfectly balanced. Live Action Cut Scenes - You will experience live action cut scenes directly from The Dev himself made special for this game. Totally unskippable Immersive 3D Audio - Enjoy the atmosphere of ocean waves on Dev Island or the synth soundscape of the blockchain Full Graphic Scaling - So that regardless of your system, The Dev will be optimized for you. No loot boxes, micro-transactions or ANY additional purchases required - With the purchase of this game, you will never have to pay for any other content regardless of what it is in the future. Zero Customization - Enjoy the game how The Dev intended. Ponzi Boy Slaying - Live your wildest dreams as you take out the Ponzi Boy virtually inside this game Next Level Jumping Puzzles These will blow your mind and make you want to rip your hair out.

489,"Ghostory is a 2D platformer designed around switching between physical and ghostly forms in order to solve increasingly taxing puzzles. Despite starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns. Ghostory won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016. In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form, they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow them to survive and escape the cave unscathed. The game comes packed with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls, always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles. Complex, occasionally fiendish puzzles. Dozens of unique levels. Smooth animations, and quality pixel art. Engagingly deep plot complete with rather silly puns. Atmospheric music to tie in with the detailed environments of each level. Smooth and responsive controls. Important mushrooms. In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods. Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will. Thankfully, an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote, but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.","“Do you love puzzle games?

The Devil has converted a tenement building into monsters-only housing, and has big plans for the future. Sucker monsters into moving into your building, charge them rent and keep them happy by buying them furniture. Unfortunately, heroes have caught wind of the Devil's plan, and will stop at nothing to wipe him out. Knock on residents' doors to call them to battle, trap heroes in devious pincer formations, and command your troops to victory. Monsters get jobs, fall in love, have children, and even skip out on their rent. Keep them happy or you might not have anyone to fight for you when heroes come knocking. But don't be too soft: there's always prospective baddies looking to move in, so kick out the freeloaders when the time is right! Being a landlord is a difficult job, but it can't be harder than running Hell...right? Every monster is different. Some are lazy. Some are strong. Some are perverts. Use an intuitive mouse-based control scheme to command your troops into battle. Encounter more than 20 different monster species, and take their money. Build a reputation with different monster families based on your performance and play style. Take on quests at your pace to unlock new monsters and furniture. Build a stronger army as residents have children far stronger than themselves. Get monsters in the mood for love with inappropriately shaped erotic cakes. Look on in horror as lovingly hand-drawn monsters and humans horribly slaughter each other over money.

Wynona is a depressed young girl who is convinced she is the Doom Bringer that will end the world. His final task is to kill her and she's trying to die - it should be a match made in heaven. But here's the catch: She's unkillable.

723,"Ripped Pants at Work is a frantic stealth game about searching for new pants. Players control an ordinary office worker on their first day of work. After an unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for new pants. Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some pants are easy to find. Some are a bit trickier! This happens to everybody! Ripping your pants is one of those things that everyone can sympathize with, but it's still so embarrassing. Every time you play, you'll control a new, randomly generated character! If you find pants successfully, you'll continue as the same person. If you get caught with no pants, you'll be fired and play as the next person hired for the job! Sneak through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and people. Break line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across streets and through buildings with a unique brand of stealth. Play the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If you get caught pantsless by too many people, you'll get fired for indecency. The cycle continues with the next person to get hired for your job. Best your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in the shortest amount of time!","“For three bucks on Steam it’s a no-brainer if you’re looking for a good way to kill time before bed or, if you’re a true sneaky mastermind, at work while you should be writing memos and whatnot.” 8/10 – Game Space “Nearly everything about this game is an absolute delight...” 85/100 – Steam Shovelers “The game, needless to say, is very funny.

737,"DISCLAIMER FOR ADDITIONAL USER REVIEWS , please visit the 'Company of Heroes - Legacy Edition' page. Total conversions available on Steam for COH1 are also listed on the Legacy Edition page. DESCRIPTION Delivering a visceral WWII gaming experience, Company of Heroes redefines real time strategy gaming by bringing the sacrifice of heroic soldiers, war-ravaged environments, and dynamic battlefields to life. Beginning with the D-Day Invasion of Normandy, players lead squads of Allied soldiers into battle against the German war machine through some of the most pivotal battles of WWII. Through a rich single player campaign, players experience the cinematic intensity and bravery of ordinary soldiers thrust into extraordinary events. A Cinematic Single Player Experience that captures the turmoil of WWII as never before.

Stunning Visuals - Relic's next generation cutting-edge engine provides graphic quality and a physics driven world that is unprecedented in an RTS. Environmental Strategy - Real-time physics and a completely destructible environment guarantee no two battles ever play out in the same way. Destroy anything and re-shape the battlefield! Use buildings and terrain to your advantage, or deny them to the enemy. 2-8 Player Multiplayer Competition via LAN or Internet - Go online with friends and join the ultimate battle of Axis versus Allies.","“It's beautiful, though that's entirely the wrong word. This is a war game, so the word should be 'visceral' or something. Models are hugely detailed for an RTS, physics implemented impressively and so on. But relevantly, it's a functional sort of beauty (or - er - viscerality).” 10/10 – Eurogamer “Company of Heroes should be on the must-play list of every RTS fanatic out there, even those tired of WWII settings. It's just that good.” 9.6/10 – PC Gamer “The transformation from a idyllic little town into a heap of crushed buildings and burned out husks of vehicles can be shocking. Seeing and hearing major explosions that cause bodies (and bits of bodies) to fly across the screen along with rubble from a nearby building simply puts you more into the battle than any RTS in memory.” 9.4/10 – IGN",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/header.jpg?t=1632304482,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a02fbfb9a63def39ad5dce6f52435820a3338242.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_07254123cc0b22872f31ee55eb3f0d8f004a7c85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_a965a0017ad2d2eb8b048c479e2425550191d2dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_535b5736857c63e4a7a786b90a03e30a07f8220e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_290136d7dba4eaf7c15f7cc2c58e6f1b52bc0072.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_4069148ca5c574d40ba4f3ac323c51a6ce040ea6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228200/ss_02cf401290f1a8faf7fc15ba44aac553359d9cc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1632304482","Action,Strategy"

745,"SoundSelf is the collision of centuries-old mindfulness wisdom and the videogame trance. It's an exhilarating journey into altered states of consciousness powered by your own voice.

You will hear about the eight Master Explorers and the artist, writer and inventor, the unique and perfect Mivos Esterus. EONIA is a game to be enjoyed alone. A vast and colorful place where you must explore every corner to know its mysteries and legends. You will find books and scrolls that will help you learn new skills and discover the rich history that surrounds it. There are dozens of items and a wide variety of skills. You can navigate by boat and over land to travel long distances in seconds thanks to the Magic Portals that the Forgotten Civilization built years ago. You can build structures and the chests and their mysteries will not be a difficult task if you have a lockpick and the necessary knowledge. A skill tree will show you everything you already know and how much you need to learn. Let's not forget that Albius is a simple apprentice. A complete inventory will allow you to track objects and know their characteristics and uses. A mission journal will allow you to understand what remains to be done and what adventure to continue. Life surrounds each stone and you will have to learn what advantage you can get from it through all kinds of books. Books are an inexhaustible source of knowledge in the EONIA world and there are many of them and, perhaps with a little luck, you will be able to solve the mysteries of EONIA.

917,"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. Features: Survive the Wild West with the cleverness of a young hero Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles Use a playful arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes Inspire other children towards the path to freedom Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","“Honig Studios’s awareness of the genre it’s stepping into and its visual sophistication suggests good things for a dreamlike spaghetti-western” Killscreen “A stealth game set in a spaghetti western setting, developed by Honig studio.

1007,"A young man awakens in a forest, deep in the Hinodean wilds. He doesn't remember how he got there, or where he needs to be. Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way... Customize your heroes the way you want. The game contains 54 weapons, 150 different types of armor and accessories, and 92 unique skills and spells for the heroes to learn. Additionally, there are 54 gems to equip, which enhance the heroes' skills in different ways. The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time! There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will help or hinder you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed during the fight. Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends. No grinding. The game is a linear adventure focusing on battles, visual novel segments, and visiting merchants to resupply. Difficulty can be changed at any time, even during dialogue. Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting. Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, and can damage an enemy's armour. The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, coming to terms with the world's true nature, and the concept of trust. Characters Aedric Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know. In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well. Rhea A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him. Although immature at times, and quick to anger, Rhea is loyal to those she loves, and will often put herself in danger, without a second thought. In battle, Rhea fights with her fists, delivering quick strikes, which allow her to build stamina quickly. Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act more often than her friends. Athena Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes. She is burdened by the guilt of her past, and is incredibly consumed with how the world, and her Goddess, perceives her. In battle, Athena is capable of treating the wounds of her allies, purging them of ailments, and bringing them back from the brink of death. Additionally, Athena possesses powerful prayers, which increase various aspects of her friends' offensive and defensive strengths.

The presence of moments where the player's choices affect what happens next. Nice visual style and atmosphere of the cold, winter world. Atmospheric soundtrack to keep the right mood. Important note: the game was created by one person, so it can not offer a long duration. On average, it takes an hour and a half to get through the game. It's important to me that you know this before you buy, so you won't be disappointed about it afterwards. Thank you for your understanding!","“Once in Flowerlake is a game to pass a few hours with. It may be on the short side as to playtime but the price point reflects this. I do think the game could have some dark tones added to it so the main character can be seen a little more clearly and adjust the text so it can be read without the player having to climb into the screen. There are a few twists and turns in the plot that keep you hooked to push on to see its conclusion.” I Like It – LadiesGamers “Once in Flowerlake is an atmospheric game for people with patience, and I genuinely mean that in the nicest possible way. It portrays individual components well, such as stagnant routine, temporary friendships, a foreign world, and what trudging through snow feels like, but all of these elements mixed together get in each other’s way at times. If you feel to your core that life is about the journey, not the destination, Once in Flowerlake is a tiny yet tantalizing tale worth playing through.” 3/5 – Hey Poor Player",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/header.jpg?t=1642282701,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4f917411b92bf7f7cd7eb5a8d9e493496fd1b290.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_47f5bb873000670355ced7e84e6f4f7f2a9b992b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_9a3bfa37192c5f4b40463722da5d7398ab7af92a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4ad416e32e63c4fece0d6f58876e4f6711f5ec6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_92c10f6b3c25e774f03b9561f291e8ce17f2e069.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_8323875624f81f191cf5b74f39faa536f0d87196.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_05fbcfbc2c759ba752b1f4c0f63fb920845bd36d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_687223fffd4fc085987e5f17afdcb92050fc4aa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701","Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation"

Game pits heavily armed players against machines that have only one goal, destroy humanity. SETTING The world of machines is dark, violent and grim. They will not stop until all humans are dead. THE PLOT When an advanced weaponry base goes dark, George Flow is sent in to check things out. When boarded the transport carrier, the mention of advanced weaponry development, brought back flashbacks. Flow remembered the day many years prior, when he was at school. He remembered sitting in the office and staring outside the window for his parents to arrive. He remembered waiting and watching and no one ever showing up. Likely one of the most devastating sights was that of a police car driving up to the school. Its pace was slow. All George remembered was pain. His parents were dead. Gone forever. It felt surreal at the time. His father had been presenting newest and most versatile combat robot to date. The real achievement of Artificial Intelligence.

Yes, only if you're not good at it 'Simple' as in straightforward. Later levels in the game can be quite challenging There's a story but it's not shoved in your face NPCs don't keep you for too long. They don't beat around the bush or waste your time trying to be funny Some NPCs have a line of dialogue. Others might even be wearing hats. There are a total of four achievements to unlock You don't defeat an 'evil mastermind'. There's no boss fights I have ideas for Lovely Planet 2. I also have a prototype ready Look, I can't really explain why it's not a shooter game. I wanted to make a platformer, so I made a platformer. Okay? You're still reading this? Pro tip - there is in fact a second jump button the game never tells you about Here's the solution to level 32 - Jump straight down, hang a right and carefully crawl along the passage till you hit a left turn. From there, carefully drop to your right and go straight till you reach the end of the beam. Drop down to the platform below and follow the path to your left. You'll find an NPC there who will show you the rest of the way. Don't look for the Mad Wizard in the forest, the NPCs, they're lying to you","“The jumping is stiff, the enemies don’t move very much...” 3.5 – Saving Content “...a fun and challenging title where mechanics and the fluff of power ups are stripped down to let the actual platforming shine” Verdict : Buy – Pardon the Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/header.jpg?t=1618279716,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_d20adbef0ccaac948e4b1f46067d2a2bc06bba0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_effaac7b7d8b69d970d3613832c0f63635963829.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_3b5c3019dbafce55291418e5cfc30805e9d6b917.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_37ccfad23a08e424f2b40a5638d7d30798507de6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_7e224271e10c59255bdab1f08eb34bc9153b2d74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/588540/ss_5bf95940e4547f9d46f1fc5897c8965d273a4ee8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618279716",Indie

1132,"Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online! Featuring Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players. Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City. Modes and options: Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...

1308,"In her mid-20's, Kelly has been forced to move back to Nebraska. Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home. Three Fourths Home is a visual short story in which you assume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother. Three Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation. Gameplay As a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home . Between the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home. New to the Extended Edition For its Steam release, Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an expanded edit of the initial release as well as several new elements, including a new epilogue in addition to a number of extra features. Epilogue: Idling in the Rubble Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, Idling in the Rubble follows another conversation that Kelly has with her mother. The 20-30 minute experience delves into Kelly's past, examining her reasons for moving back to Nebraska and her internal struggle following the events of the main game.

Features - 96 game levels to solve - Pixel art graphics - 3 gold crowns to skip levels - No time limit - No enemies","“Well, looks aren’t everything. I suppose neither is originality. Pixel Boy is pretty plainly inspired by the likes of Sokoban and Chip’s Challenge, and in terms of its presentation it certainly doesn’t blow past either of those decades-old games. But hey, we don’t come to puzzle games for the good looks. We’re here for the puzzles, and Pixel Boy has some good ones. Ninety-six stages in total, and the complexity of those stages often translates to a few mini-puzzles in each to solve. The goal in each stage is to push the red crate to the specified goal and then head into the exit that appears. You’ll have to deal with gimmicks like locked doors, pits, fire, and more.

Online and Offline Multiplayer for up to 6 players Single Player Campaign with 42 levels Use the Level Editor to create, share and play your own levels AI controlled players with 4 difficulty levels Unique challenges which will grant you 5 different powerups! The game can be played with 2 to 6 players, with players joining online, offline or with bots as a substitute. Each player is controlling a single color of tiles on the board. Every turn, the player is allowed to rotate one tile of the color that they control clockwise. If the tile now points at an opponent's tile or an empty tile, that tile will change color and spread that color to all the tiles connected to it. In the end, your goal is to make sure no other player has any more tiles of their color on the board! Besides the regular tiles, the game features 8 special tile types: The Double Tile : points in both directions The Counterclockwise Tile : rotates counterclockwise The Tunnel Tile : can only be taken over from two ends The Suction Tile : assumes the color of the tile it points at The Flip Tile : flips when it changes color The Freeze Tile : freezes for a turn The Fire Tile : burns after the turn it was taken over The Bomb Tile : explodes after changing color twice",“There’s a huge amount to like about how well done Hexteria is for such a simple basic mechanic that keeps me wanting more from it.

Designed for all generations it contains missions with nice and colorful enemies while focused on the arcade element of the gameplay. This being said, this is an upfront disclaimer about a lot of repetitiveness in the gameplay as it is the case with older arcade games. You dive into deep space escorting a cargo ship from your fleet. Quickly you realize you're within the boundaries of enemy territory. Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself. Victory doesn't come easy as you have to earn every single space credit out there fighting in over 50 missions. By clearing your mission objectives, reward is coming to your account and you're ready to upgrade your ship with decoys, shields, laser boosters and much more. You can even buy a new, better fighter. As you progress, you will get engaged in trading earned resources such as cobalt, nickel, palladium and others in trading room every space station features. Build your strategy by carefully choosing routes from your space station towards another and have your take in every mission. Each mission will pit a challenge in front of you and most of the missions will get you to face a bigger and badder alien ships.","“The retro trend in video games remains strong, but not many of these love letters to old school gaming could pass for an actual retro game release.

1449,"More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum.

1550,"You are the glass eye of a very forgetful explorer. Deep inside an ancient ruin, somewhere in a lost world behind the Bermuda Triangle known as the World of Clouds, you were removed and left behind all alone. Now you must uncover the secrets of the maze and find a way out by yourself. EyeRoll is extremely simple and relaxing to play. You are rolling a glass eye through a maze and must uncover secrets and solve puzzles to find your way out. It is recommended you play with a mouse that has a scroll wheel since you can use that to move the follow camera closer to objects of interest in order to study them so they can serve as clues as to how to find a way out of the maze. It is perfectly suitable for a person of any age and is safe and enjoyable for very young children. The movements of the glass eye player character in the game is purely physics driven. It can bounce around, jump, spin and bump into things. It is controlled using the WASD keys and space bar for jumping. The player looks through a single follow camera with a semi top down view on the glass eye and field of view can be adjusted by moving the camera in closer or further away from the eye. So you could set how much your see of the maze yourself and in doing so challenge yourself accordingly. Look carefully at sigils and markings on objects since they hold clues. Avoid patches of sand. That will dry the eye and eventually cause it to crack up and you lose the game. Keep the eye moisturized by rolling it through water puddles. You can exit the game at any time by pressing the escape key on your keyboard and you can pause the game by pressing P on your keyboard. There are no saving or checkpoint functions.

A round is called a 'rebel' and one match can consist of one to five 'rebels'. To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a 'unique' technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character. Key Features 12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager. Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent.

1586,"Year 1442, Unified Calendar The world has been plunged into a devastating state of chaos, as two mighty powers wage war for supremacy. The Vollcross Empire, a brutal fascist regime, has launched a surprise invasion of the Kazanov Union, intent on eradicating the perceived communist threat. In the early days of the war, the Empire's forces were unstoppable, crushing opposition with ruthless efficiency. But as the Union mobilized its vast population and fought back, the Empire's supply lines began to falter, and the once certain victory began to slip away. The fate of the war now rests on Khaligrad, a key city that holds the precious oil fields both sides desperately need. The Union forces have dug in and are putting up fierce resistance, turning the battle into a brutal and prolonged conflict. Welcome to a place where war is the only truth, where victory is the only option. Welcome to the front, officer. Choose your side Khaligrad offers you 2 challenging campaigns. Will you fight for the Empire, a formidable invader with limited supplies and distant support? Or will you stand with the Union, the motherland boasting vast armies but struggling with inferior equipment? Face the Men... Whether it's securing a strategic point, defending an ammunition stockpile or simply eradicating the enemy, every mission in the campaign involves combat. You will lead several squads of soldiers of various quality and morale in a turn-based tactical battle. Ambush your opponents and use the terrain to your advantage to ensure victory. Urban guerrilla warfare is no easy playground. ... and the War In Khaligrad, the greatest adversary is not the enemy, but the harshness of war itself. Between missions, you'll need to care for your wounded, feed, heat and equip your men. But resources are scarce and winter is getting steadily harsher. Difficult choices lie ahead. Tell your own story Depending on your successes and failures during the campaign, your story evolves and takes different directions. The missions entrusted to you by your HQ evolve accordingly. Will you become a so-called hero who always manages to repel the enemy despite numbers?

1587,"40 miles under the Earth's surface, a hazardous research and refinery facility has faulted. Attempts to raise communication with the installment have failed. The status of all fifteen workers stationed within the facility is unknown. Valvorta Industries, the controversial energy corporation responsible for the site, must maintain discretion. In response, Valvorta's BoD has elected to dispatch an engineering specialist to assess the situation. The mission is simple: recover information, restore output from the facility and rescue the workers trapped under earth. Traversal through the facility will not be easy. The malfunctioning systems have made the descent near impossible. The high temperatures and the lack of breathable oxygen require the use of a specialized suit. You'll need a sharp eye to find any tools, lifts, documentation, and devices scattered across the facility, and a bright mind to put them to use. Extra attention must be paid to maintaining your suit's battery and air levels if you wish to survive. To make your mission easier, your suit provides a gauge on your current status, a log of any documents you find scattered about, magnetic boot attachments function for situational vertical and upside-down movement, and an instant connection to all terminals requiring rudimentary programming skills. Find whatever information you can and piece together the events leading to the loss in communications. After that, it will be up to you to decide what needs to be done.","“The highlights of the game for me are the a-ha moments.

Think of the first time you grabbed a controller and played as a character who rampaged through a world, killing everything in sight. Have you ever stopped to think how those little guys felt? Well now it's time for some payback! Kill The plumber is a parody to other platformers. Your goal is to stop the 'protagonist' from winning each level. You start off as a slow minion who can't even jump, but has enough power to kill the hero. As you get the hang of it, you start playing as other enemies that can jump, shoot, stomp and even fly, sometimes controlling more than one character at a time! It was a peaceful day in the kingdom, when all of a sudden a plumber decided to construct pipes everywhere and cause destruction. No matter what the critters throw at him, he kept coming back, and even tried to kidnap their princess.

1772,"THE DRAGON'S LEGACY The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this 'being?' deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr. GAMEPLAY You, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself. That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight. Through 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay. You will also fall under the spell of 'The I of the Dragon' with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring. FEATURES A choice of three dragons each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon. There are no limits to the possibilities 12 unique territories representing various geographical areas: mountains desserts, forests and savanna etc. Each map has over 10 square kilometers to cover More than 60 spells with special effects available to each dragon Real time Terra-Forming allows complete mountain ranges disappear and reappear in another location Static and real-time lighting ensure the correct lighting conditions to every day and night cycle Fascinating sunsets and a night sky full of stars await you The Time Control-Option makes it possible to adjust 'The I of The Dragon' to your own speed Slow motion mode with a fascinating effect","“Very good!

1893,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.",“...

1435,"Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments. Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator. The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.","“'Immersion” means different things to different players. Turn-based and RTS players identify so much with their units that they feel they are members of the force. Simulation and FPS players have even more visceral connections: they are virtually on the spot, spewing bullets and doing Split-Ss. Submarine simulations tend to combine both styles. The main position is the captain’s positions in the command center where he can pick targets by the periscope. He can also click on dials to control speed, course and depth. Some simulations can send players to specific compartments like engineering, fire control, sonar/radar, radio, even crew quarters via clicks on icons. Still, the player is in control with no real change in perspective. Skvader Studios’ – aided by Subsim.com -- Wolfpack gives a whole new dimension to submarine sims.” Wargamer “If you've ever dreamed of working on a 'highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War', Wolfpack is the game for you.” PC Gamer “'It was our second mission, so our three-man crew was a little nervous. Even though my two gaming buddies and I cracked jokes about our rather limited adventures at sea we knew that we were playing a game that was deadly serious. We were tasked with seeking out and destroying any British supply convoys that we came across in the frigid waters of the North Sea. Wolfpack is not an easy game. It sure managed to flummox my two gaming buddies and I when we initially tried it out. This is not a submarine simulator where many of the complex calculations and controls are streamlined for you. No, this is a full-on simulator which forces you to come to grips with your chosen U-boats many machinations all by yourselves. And when everything comes together and your crew finally comes to grips with Wolfpack’s carefully articulated mechanics, the game becomes a thing of beauty that I personally haven’t experienced in most of the games I’ve played.'” 91% – CyberpowerPC",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/header.jpg?t=1656691181,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_dd6654732d7261e5fb4c5ee4f63f49ad6143541f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_ec187beedf2c7504857d6a9a25e5c7fd79ca1e36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_88fa2d011259c4e1b1e1da51b4cb3ef997e71043.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_d54a7ef3fc5a497ded88f3c09532ea18e8c19985.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_2a2533d19d6d1e70e567c1ded189023ce449bc63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_1d7f15a4c6c28dbca91811a4c35896007e586948.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_17ee58fba53ddeffd81c1385257509112ea6d63a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_65965f21354129c7848ecc8197687f87b3b59ec5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_a042ad87f156b2389c5a0657c1e7f4d287886a1c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_bfaa50c33f5445255938c317a6688666b879b452.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/490920/ss_aacb4eb6389039d66a774c74fb4a407deb6c8c3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656691181","Simulation,Early Access"

1448,"Zotrix is an arcade space shooter inspired by early shooter games on arcade machines from 80's and early 90's. Designed for all generations it contains missions with nice and colorful enemies while focused on the arcade element of the gameplay. This being said, this is an upfront disclaimer about a lot of repetitiveness in the gameplay as it is the case with older arcade games. You dive into deep space escorting a cargo ship from your fleet. Quickly you realize you're within the boundaries of enemy territory. Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself. Victory doesn't come easy as you have to earn every single space credit out there fighting in over 50 missions. By clearing your mission objectives, reward is coming to your account and you're ready to upgrade your ship with decoys, shields, laser boosters and much more. You can even buy a new, better fighter. As you progress, you will get engaged in trading earned resources such as cobalt, nickel, palladium and others in trading room every space station features. Build your strategy by carefully choosing routes from your space station towards another and have your take in every mission. Each mission will pit a challenge in front of you and most of the missions will get you to face a bigger and badder alien ships.","“The retro trend in video games remains strong, but not many of these love letters to old school gaming could pass for an actual retro game release.

1481,"Run Prop, Run! is a multiplayer hide'n'seek game. It is inspired by the classic Prop Hunt mod where players must disguise themselves as an object in the scenery to avoid detection by a hunter. Run Prop, Run! can have up to 12 players and begins with one Hunter trying to catch other hiding Prop players. As each Prop gets caught, they will turn into Hunters making it more and more difficult for the remaining Props to survive the hunt. To help the Props survive, they are given the ability to transform into any object in the stage so they can better blend into the environment. When a Hunter captures a prop, it turns it into a Hunter. Start 1 Hunter VS 11 Props, and finish with up to 11 Hunters VS 1 prop! It's not just Prop Hunt Hide and Seek.

1701,"Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe.

1807,"Set in a creepy amusement park hiding a dark and sinister secret, The Park is a one to two hour-long first-person psychological horror experience focusing on intense storytelling and exploration instead of combat and action. A day at the park... a lost teddy bear... a missing child. As the sun sets over Atlantic Island Park, you must explore its dilapidated rides in search of your son, Callum. As darkness falls, you will experience panic and paranoia through a narrative written by a team of award-winning storytellers. Amusement parks are happy places, filled with the joys of childhood and the exhilarating rush of fantastic rides to be dared.

No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words. Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.

1819,"Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered.

1907,"Land Doctrine is a 3D sandbox strategy game. You can design tanks, manage research, equip infantry, set up infantry training, optimize production and build combined arms battalions to crush your enemies. You have complete freedom to customize your army and you will need both superior designing and logistical skills as well as masterful tactics to outsmart your opponents and triumph on the battlefield. The combat system is based on measuring anti-tank firepower against armor and anti-personnel firepower against infantry cover while the combat distance gradually decreases during the battle. The terrain affects the starting distance of engagement, cover and tank maneuverability. Side, rear or top armor is exposed to enemy fire when tanks are fighting in complex environments, like woods, urban areas or marshland. It is an accurate and clever yet immediate system designed around the idea of optimizing your divisions. Therefore, research is an important part of the game. You can develop new tank engines, suspension, guns and infantry weapons or improve industrial efficiency and training methods. You can design a new tank, set up a production line to produce it and increase the production capacity by capturing enemy cities. Proper training is essential for victory. Inadequate training will cause increased casualties, while good training will generate combat bonuses. The training capacity is also limited: optimize carefully. You can manage infantry equipment at the platoon level. Select small arms and heavy weapons to provide the necessary firepower, then unleash it to see your enemies vanquished! Main features: - Randomly generated maps - More than 2100 possible tank designs - Tech tree with 99 research projects - Customizable infantry equipment with 23 infantry weapons - Custom training doctrines","“For just $5 it’s a damned good deal” 8/10 – The Strategy Gamer “The cost of entry is minimal, and though far be it for me to assess value for money, Land Doctrine is cheap enough to warrant satisfying curiosity.” Wargamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/header.jpg?t=1574261137,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_1b54cee2971b285be8d2a186088f9ab876ab88d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a08999934e066fa9fd3380af2ead93bc786ab7c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a0e8f8f832297e086a979ae26eb31b758b92ef04.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bde2ba1ff5101569fe3d43e852dc66f5a70db9db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_ed2b67833bd645c94a0127063714a269a486637d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_bc299eaaa80f8d526c0fabbcba6bdeb2f1f04f60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_675050d42ddb62b9ca4977033fa3a3a1d6be06ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_6248933a509d548c71e9b73ab2d76ed19aa250d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_24c5c6b8d04afc6f302997c6280720055332ab52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_28591a67bee4874f67838b9c9d32327557e525d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_b2b74305e5ab375887c94c4f1ffccd8eaa1646ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f26030f74c37dfa9a44b8745bc0f69190ba81502.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_7f811deb7bbce013e59675c590e447980d3143b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_88faa81decdf1ff0c9ec926de357aff696c46462.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_c79a405a96f6b95187e0eaaef0896f3d9618f314.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_680c111b2f8eebb9665a0dcd9c0a4b3b6759225a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_5c7964dcbb89627afb3dd3759852587f8d5c3894.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_fa99b807ad54d7d1d163205511744ba9d28c8b9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_71b95b026d47c881c50d9912112c3d52eb50d4ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_a8053b9d8f531163d4f83171937845abe693229b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_8c6bc33c52b89bc70a450ace6b84100a486b2291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_f4b87415138d42efa681167d6107b13a16089f08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/600740/ss_e828f61c18eacc82873731dfa2a8e8ce72aa9950.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574261137","Indie,Strategy"

1960,"PRiO is a visually-striking, yet challenging platformer about manipulating the environment around you. To complete a stage, you must light up all the blocks in a level. The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.","“sharp gameplay that’s right at the sweet-spot between too tough and too easy” Indie Game Magazine “PRiO is punishing, but in the best possible way” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/header.jpg?t=1478028084,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_79ccab4e49d954efce2fa70da483d7a52f29053a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_536bb4fdca229cc1a7ab65687341aa0052558b6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_6da76fe06e8ea30723eb371b47a5e43ca38513dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_a5911b9a3df6318a5a5ae4dd5a583afea1f3861b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_2806fe65917768d21e8a4165c6f213c2f2c88437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_45518e5f667c5fb4d5a4efcbba69d3cb87b1248d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_972e56577c519056e1c54dc53db25d970e9e6b1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_add9cf6e0e090c946512879934b88d8ac02ca983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084","Action,Adventure,Indie"
