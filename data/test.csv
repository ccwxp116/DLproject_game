30,"Are ghosts real? You are on your first solo ghost hunting case, under the watchful instructions of Bear and Jen from the O.P.G paranormal team. Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views. Full 360 exploration and soundtrack recorded on location. Interact with ghost-hunting gadgets to investigate. Encounter real-world paranormal activity based on witness statements. Puzzles and ghost identification. Experience a haunting based on eye witness accounts. Completely AI driven phenomena, the ghosts are aware!

FREE UPDATE HISTORY","“Calling Stellaris Europa Universalis in space is probably reductive, but it was the first thing I did in this review not because they are almost exactly alike, but because, when I put away my empires and get on with my day, the stories that have played out in these digital worlds embed themselves in my brain, and I so desperately want to tell people about them. Both games tickle the part of my brain that wants every battle to have some greater context, every move I make to be part of a larger narrative. Stellaris manages to do this without history to lean on, though, and does so with aplomb.” 9/10 – PCGamesN “An excellent science fiction space strategy game” The New York Times “Stellaris is one of the best space 4X strategy games around, allowing you to create your very own civilization, venture out into the unknown and meet new species as you explore the stars.” Windows Central",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/header.jpg?t=1656004728,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_f844372cc220e3858aa17205e9fec0ae79a4e665.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_692532123e560e6b866baee59b1e310a291a110d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_7f4d7cc160c43e77aa523e910b365e0ca436e6bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_034b0d55a5c370bec4709f09d0914f9d131b7788.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_ee82888c27afb4174cf4cae6298b54c7c1e2a682.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/281990/ss_fc94710913be85306f2fe5258d0f0d8d1c87e945.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656004728","Simulation,Strategy"

85,"JimJams games are a small, indie development team with a love for the retro games of the '80's and 90's. We only develop games that embrace that era, aiming to provide true classicly styled gaming, with a massive retro feel, maybe with a slight hint of what these games would have been with a little more processing power. We don't aim to develop AAA games, but simply to bring our passion for a time gone by to those who love truly classic themed and inspired games. If this is a genre and era that you love, then our games are for you. Solar Wind is our take on the classic sidescrolling shoot 'em ups of the past. Fight your way through deep space, penetrate asteriod belts, swoop low across alien moons, and weave through narrow caverns, and alien complexes as you take the fight to an unknown enemy. Solar Wind encompasses many elements of the classic side scrolling, shoot 'em ups. Blast asteroids, take on alien ships, upgrade your ship with numerous add-ons, and navigate the unknown in the retro-themed blaster. We've taken our love of such games as Scramble, R-Type, Gradius, Vanguard, and a load more and combined our favourite features of each....

Do not deviate from your routine. Suffer the Curse! Stick your scentflaps where you shouldn't, and you may just walk away with an ancient cranial entity haunting your every waking moment!

127,"THERE SWINGS A SKULL The town of Pareildas stands in the center of a vast desert. Its citizens live their lives quietly. Or, at least, they once did. In recent days the speaker-gallows sprang, weedlike, in the heart of the town - and since its inception the denizens of Pareildas have been sacrificed, one by one. The electric words that spew from the gallows claim this is to staunch the blistering hatred of the vengeful sun... but the heat has only grown more and more unbearable. OUR PROTAGONISTS Anatoli works for the town train station. He dreams of leaving Pareildas, so that he might peacefully live out the rest of his life with his husband. His dreams share much in common with the blackened husks of the town's denizens that line the streets. Pyotr is an independent artist. He hopes, deeply, that he might do something to stop the hellfire slowly consuming Pareildas. But the price of stopping the natural order is immensely steep - and, of course, there's no guarantee this is a natural occurrence at all... ABOUT THE GAME There Swings a Skull: Grim Tidings is a narrative-horror game built in RPG Maker 2003 by Conor Walsh and Quinn K., with music by Leaf Let. Though the game initially released as a jam game it was so well-received - and sat so well with our team - that we decided to build it out into a full game. Conor Walsh is a professional narrative designer who has written on such titles as The Outer Worlds, A Place, Forbidden, The DreadX Collection 2, and many others. Quinn K. brought indie darling OFF to the English-speaking world and recently released the stylish and moody AN OUTCRY. We hope you enjoy our work. FEATURES A deep central narrative Gorgeous pixel and fullscreen graphics A unique, haunting soundtrack Two separate routes and a third that we dare not mention Multiple endings A hateful sun The endless ocean Death","““THERE SWINGS A SKULL” has found its very own formal language to draw attention to the brutality of the climate catastrophe. Medium and long-term effects such as droughts and heat waves are represented here by a merciless sun that can literally pulverize people. This narrative sledgehammer is countered by the individual characters and their interaction with the world. In a short time, players witness how people stop dreaming, how they project their fears and how their facades crumble in the face of impending doom. All this happens in such a poetic way that it makes you ache.” The Game Curator “All of this surreal oddity and foreboding doom gives There Swings a Skull a very different feel from most horror games.... the town is the monster – a horrifying sun-baked purgatory that has no escape.

The player can change his katana position at any time to adjust to his opponent's, creating a mind game where you have to anticipate his next attack.

184,"Set in the Black Hills of South Dakota, this interactive VR documentary takes participants into the subterranean depths of Sanford Research Lab and Wind Cave as they unravel the cosmos from different angles. Participants are invited to navigate the former Homestake Goldmine turned cutting-edge laboratory 4,850 feet below ground, where scientists employ a cosmic microphone to investigate the nature of dark matter. In tandem, the story also takes participants into the vast underground network of Wind Cave, the labyrinth of ancient passageways at the heart of the Lakota Sioux creation story. Both spaces transport us into a realm of sheer darkness as they explore what lies beyond light. Using volumetric video capture technologies that see beyond the spectrum of visible lights, this immersive documentary crafts a dialogue between the scientific frontier and a realm of spiritual belief that co-exist in the storied Black Hills. As the diptych emerges in this interactive narrative, visitors to the underground are turned inwards to find their common ground.",“Subterranean Worlds of Science and Spirituality” Museum of the Moving Image,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/header.jpg?t=1609342031,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_e5ca7d3dd0da521b33ca7ecae2423c63b5b95ac3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_a4edd63d3ee22712172bbfd2c9726d2206fc671a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_6bbab9796d6b0e2c0248a0239d39e0d1054cc1fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_b0d771e2af55e1837e450de2ef5d9a3a4095e579.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_8a784b3acd88e595dde0b2d122d365f5352d2558.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1229740/ss_7b1b6c22db1990a4faf235caf6d66883253279ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609342031",Education

230,"With Star Trek: Infinite there is no singular way to play. Whether you wish to take the route of diplomacy, espionage, warfare, or a mix of all of these, there are multiple paths to victory. You are in the command, and the fate of the galaxy is in your hands! Choose between the United Federation of Planets, Klingon Empire, Romulan Star Empire, or Cardassian Union. You will take on the role of the leader in charge of all the major decisions of your faction as the game unfolds. With each faction having their own unique styles of play, your decisions determine how successful you are in reaching your goals. Star Trek: Infinite has been meticulously created to provide an immersive Star Trek experience while allowing you to shape the story of your playthrough according to the choices you make as the leader of your chosen faction. As you take on the role of the Federation, you'll have the opportunity to recruit iconic captains and officers, including Picard, Janeway, Sisko, and Data to name a few. Meanwhile, other factions offer their own set of iconic characters to enlist, such as Gowron, Makbar, Garak, and many more. Beyond the potential cast of characters you recruit to your faction, the game grants you access to a range of starships from the Star Trek universe, tailored to each faction's arsenal. From the Federation's reliable Intrepid- and Defiant-class ships, the menacing Cardassian Galor-class vessels, the sleek Romulan D'deridex, or even the formidable Klingon Negh'Var battleships. Of course, the Enterprise-D can be developed and added to the Federation fleet through the bespoke storytelling system developed for Star Trek: Infinite. Star Trek: Infinite is built upon the core systems of Stellaris, leveraging the deep and complex system and making them its own. Aspects of these systems have been streamlined and simplified to better resonate with the Star Trek franchise.","“Star Trek: Infinite is a 4X grand strategy game that shares a lot of qualities with a good Star Trek episode: It’s cerebral, accessible, occasionally a little clumsy, and overall a good time.” Polygon “...If you’re a huge Trekkie and just happen to also like video games, Star Trek: Infinite will beam boatloads of fun right into your living room.” Video Games (Sports Illustrated) “This game is made for Star Trek fans through and through.

Maybe you'll even have the pleasure of meeting Barry at some point. One of the enemies you fight is a skateboarding platypus.","“It’s a joy exploring Deathbulge’s charming cartoony world, listening to its excellent soundtrack, meeting its quirky inhabitants and battling weird foes.

393,"An intense, arcade-style, shooter in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story.

Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock. The Enemies : Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too...

There's no time to lose, so join forces with her, get your hands on MechaNika's controls and demolish the entire planet. You have to put an end to history books, planned obsolescence, kitschy dresses, never-ending sagas of boring video games and pea soup. And if there's someone in the world that hates vegetables more than Nika, it's her friend Agatha, the insomniac butcher and prophetess of Carnivorism that loves animals and their succulent meat in equal measure. That's why, when she learns of the objectives of Nika's plan, she doesn't hesitate to join the mission of destruction alongside the Great Bleeding Pig, god of Carnivorism, to subdue any grass-eating, non-believers that get in the way. But watch out, because along the way you'll realise that Nika and Agatha are not the only ones that have a plan to change the world, and not everything's as simple as it might have seemed at the start. You'll have to make some tough and irreversible decisions to achieve your objectives, or renounce them. Join forces with Nika, get behind the controls of MechaNika and bring an end to everything that isn't cool.

422,"What is Math Classroom Challenge? Math Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In the game the player never loses.

430,"SUMMARY Here, you will be challenged, hurt, and angered... For this, I pity you. I created this game not for you to win but for you to fail. The blockchain doesn't care about your saved file. It doesn't care whether you want to adjust your sensitivity or if you can't 'figure it out'. This game exists simply because it can. I am here to design a game that will break you, not out of spite, but because I am The Dev, and I can. If you beat this game, you are a true dev with honor. Good luck. GAMEPLAY 'The Dev: Enter The Blockchain' is a brutally punishing and annoying third-person 3D platforming game centered around the character, The Dev. In this game, you will play through multiple levels, each with its unique puzzles and challenges. From an arcade shooter level to a 3D platformer level, you'll experience the trials The Dev faces when entering the blockchain. This game unfolds within the photo-realistic, impeccably coded world of The Dev. Witness the inner workings of the blockchain, traverse the trailer park in 3D, and bask in the pure, unadulterated bliss of Dev Island. Your objective: progress through the levels to ultimately reunite with your most treasured possession. Levels you'll encounter include Dev Island, Ponzi Park, and even the blockchain itself. The clock is ticking. KEY FEATURES Enriched single-player narrative driven campaign Limited Settings - Keybindings, audio levels, mouse sensitivity... Adjust none of it. My game is perfectly balanced. Live Action Cut Scenes - You will experience live action cut scenes directly from The Dev himself made special for this game. Totally unskippable Immersive 3D Audio - Enjoy the atmosphere of ocean waves on Dev Island or the synth soundscape of the blockchain Full Graphic Scaling - So that regardless of your system, The Dev will be optimized for you. No loot boxes, micro-transactions or ANY additional purchases required - With the purchase of this game, you will never have to pay for any other content regardless of what it is in the future. Zero Customization - Enjoy the game how The Dev intended. Ponzi Boy Slaying - Live your wildest dreams as you take out the Ponzi Boy virtually inside this game Next Level Jumping Puzzles These will blow your mind and make you want to rip your hair out.

Battles need strategy, if you choose the 'Heroes Mode', you must have a strong will. As the first work independently produced, this game still has many shortcomings: 1.The map is crude.It exists only for the sake of the plot, and you don't need to explore it. 2.Unable to save freely.The game only provides automatic archiving due to the set reason. Don't worry, it is an inevitable experience to eliminate NPC. You can quickly return to this story in the second week. 3.The difficulty of BOSS is too high. It is not recommended to select 'Heroes Mode' for one week. In the tutorial map, enter Cheats to get the salted fish artifact. You can use it 3 times for the novice difficulty. You can win directly in the battle. 4.The story is inexplicable.Believe me, you will understand all this in the end. 5.The quality of English translation is not good. This is a bit difficult for the author. The game is currently in English test version: The game has only partially translated and will continue to update. Game Cheats: Entering SKIP at the beginning of the game tutorial will skip the tutorial.

The Devil has converted a tenement building into monsters-only housing, and has big plans for the future. Sucker monsters into moving into your building, charge them rent and keep them happy by buying them furniture. Unfortunately, heroes have caught wind of the Devil's plan, and will stop at nothing to wipe him out. Knock on residents' doors to call them to battle, trap heroes in devious pincer formations, and command your troops to victory. Monsters get jobs, fall in love, have children, and even skip out on their rent. Keep them happy or you might not have anyone to fight for you when heroes come knocking. But don't be too soft: there's always prospective baddies looking to move in, so kick out the freeloaders when the time is right! Being a landlord is a difficult job, but it can't be harder than running Hell...right? Every monster is different. Some are lazy. Some are strong. Some are perverts. Use an intuitive mouse-based control scheme to command your troops into battle. Encounter more than 20 different monster species, and take their money. Build a reputation with different monster families based on your performance and play style. Take on quests at your pace to unlock new monsters and furniture. Build a stronger army as residents have children far stronger than themselves. Get monsters in the mood for love with inappropriately shaped erotic cakes.

As the title suggests, the main enemy you will be fighting is zombies. But don't let that fool you, this game is much more than mindless zombie slaughter. The second you begin playing this game you embark on a dangerous journey to save the world from zombie infestation, and let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride. This game is an absolute masterpiece and I have been anxiously waiting its release ever since it was originally announced back in 2011. I can not wait to see what is to come for this game, and hopefully series, and look forward to seeing it among all the other AAA titles such as Halo, Red Dead Redemption, Call of Duty, etc. I can not stress enough how good this game is, and if you do not believe me check for yourself, this game will go down in history.” 10/10 – Kyle Guarnieri “Wow, just wow.

619,"Warships On The Halloween Night is an extreme Top Down Arcade Shooter game based on the naval war which broke out between the Human beings and the Living Pumpkins. During the early 2000s, the living pumpkins were spotted for the first time in the forest of North Carolina. There were many conspiracy theories regarding the mysterious appearance of the Living Pumpkins also known by the name 'Pumpkin Man' or 'Pumpkin bots'. It was assumed that these Pumpkin Bots were some sort of extraterrestrial beings who appeared for the very first time during the Halloween Night. However, they were secretly building their underground military base somewhere in the US. It was reported that they were building modern warships and turrets in secrecy. As soon as the US Government came to know about that secret underground base the US navy had been instructed to take a deep dive into the matter. In 2018, some of the US battleships were attacked by a few Pumpkin Head battleships which resulted in the war breaking out between the US military forces and the Pumpkin Bots. On the Halloween Night, the US Navy launched the modern warship called 'USS Special' to destroy the Pumpkin secret bases, battleships, turrets and the bots to reinstate peace in the world. Who will win in the end? Key Features: 20 Levels to Play! Different kinds of battleships and turrets. Four firing modes including primary, secondary, tertiary and missile. Challenging situations and hard to master. Easier controls. Note: I am a solo developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, artwork, programming except for the music. Thank you!

Intense and tactical combat, unique weapon mods and items that change the way you play. Foes different not only in visual design but also in their behavior. For example there is an enemy that will teleport every time you hit it, or enemy that leaves bombs that home on you, but you can shoot those bombs to use them against it. Usable items and power ups, like friendly sentry, an eye that lets you transmute items, kite that lets you fly, matchbox that ignites all foes around you, and much more!

774,"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.","“A small but perfectly formed puzzle game about building tiny cities on even tinier boards that keeps you coming back for more” Rock, Paper and Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/header.jpg?t=1700728966,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_105fb55657cb3afe319b0b897bec433ce1d1253f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_ae1b4330e539d3571909fdb467c8c09d3ffd098a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4dad8497edbbbd4f93c9a15bc9a02870ec2b277f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_f0119350752c29572124a569ff5abecc33e7b4c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fd188b47ed458f3870cf33b6728455efaa2d4353.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b2ab251ed4b3110114febafd7c9d1b2b028a7dfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4ee3c1d8a6689cb14b6d35f6aa1a039e2dc14423.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b37b85ff27fe5d0452d192618ea82544326c2e77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_72d4f99b77bb64acdb2f257ef6283a6c2a3b8e9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_288827feb003654057ac1ab3e7c80ab22ed8d299.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_e8bb0fdf7a761e4ef72b0fd5cc15ad8d2a8aabc0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b95734f5bc5ccb3bc37f831df01ffcacc86e782d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_48317c0c289aad73ac7b0a328cbe813a037ef38c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5531a761b3d21bd89c20273f296b8a42ba3e467b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5a6f818ee450d3dadf10bfd29811d18fd7a38a6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fb8b7cbd569da3d0cf48a879a421404d09d2b30d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_a65ff231a970f0dade53d4c87ce1d559ebc5ac12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_d8383fdd037bf81ab0f0f369a31a9670fc3c8b97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_8a18e68b7e789ed112720df5089a67859cff5add.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_532f4630e3b5bacd4309f35ab52b34338b7a3b89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_989e8572b7894373d4d1f1fa2661870a1ad83f68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966",Strategy

828,"Block Buster Billy is a puzzle game where you move blocks with digits and basic math operations to form numbers and equations. When you complete an equation, it turns into a big block you can move out of the way to open the treasure chest. Combining these simple rules with carefully placed blocks leads to some very challenging puzzles. Over 100 hand crafted levels Turn based gameplay Non-linear progress Light math, but tricky level layouts A goofy story about aliens visiting Billy's island There are different paths you can take on each island, so you don't have to play the levels in some particular order. If you get stuck on one puzzle, you can go back to the island and select another level. Levels are linked. Solving a level gives you a piece for the level you entered from. For every new game mechanics there are a couple easy levels that serve as tutorial. Some of the levels took me a full day to design, test and refine to perfection.

938,"The world's first and longest running Persistent MMORTS is finally on Steam! SAGA has been running since 2008, when it revolutionized the genre. We call SAGA an MMORTS because you build cities, command troops, and manage resources like in a traditional RTS, but also go on quests, chat with your friends, join guilds, and trade like an MMO. SAGA is an RTS with battling similar to the Total War series, mixed with city building from Stronghold. Build your army by collecting cards found in booster packs, or trade in-game resources for them in the auction house. Persistent World Design, build and expand your own kingdom. Manage peasants as they collect resources to help you build and maintain your fortifications even when you're not online!. Research and discover new technologies in your quest for total dominance. Customizable Units Your units level up and gain experience points that persist between battles. Collect over 100 different kinds of troops and over 50 spells. Collect loot from fallen enemies to customize and improve your units. Solo and Co-op Questing Join with friends in Cooperative Mode or battle solo on over a thousand quests ! Create and join guilds which regularly give resource benefits. Trade resources and troops with other players directly, using the Auction House, and with trade routes. PvP is completely optional , but participate in PvP for unique rewards including booster packs, troops, and items! FAQ I heard this game is pay to win. Is that true? With the latest 1.50 update, we are focusing on bringing many more cards to the game's marketplace for in-game currency, making the full experience available for free. So pay to win is now a thing of the past! Will my current SAGA account work on the Steam version? Yes, since the Steam version uses the same servers, your account will still work. You can also still use the standalone client if you prefer. Does SAGA have subscription fees? No. SAGA has absolutely no subscription fees. Instead, players are encouraged--but not required--to buy their troops in booster packs. Purchased troops remain a player's property, and can be traded with other players for different troops. Troops can also be obtained from the market with in-game gold. Troops become more powerful as you use them, gaining experience, new weapons and armor over time. Players can customize their armies to their nation type, drawing from over 150 different troop and spell types to find the combination that works best for them. Where can i find more information about the game? You can find loads more information about the game on our official site .

1012,"In 1994, the Swedish engineer, entrepreneur and adventurer Malte Stierngranat was buried in a pyramid that he had designed himself. The pyramid was erected almost half a century prior to his death, on a piece of land that Stierngranat bought close to his home. He also had his own personalised coffin built, which he always took on trips, even shorter ones. Carol is contacted by the cleaner George in the middle of a cold Swedish winter. This leads her on a journey in which she has to delve into Malte Stierngranat's illustrious life and his legacy. George is the cleaner and caretaker of Malte Stierngranat's son, Erik, and his family. The entire family, which is one of the wealthiest in the city, has gone missing. George is left without a job, and without a final paycheck. He's also worried about what has happened to the family. When Carol believes that her investigations have led her to a dead end, the boyfriend of Malte Stierngranat's granddaughter is found dead in the family's old barn. The police investigation shows that his body has been lying in the barn since the family's disappearance. Bosch's Damnation is the first Carol Reed game which takes place in both the winter and in the summer. It features numerous incredible locations for exploration, ranging from the surrealistic and idyllic to the gritty and filthy. The game is mouse driven and features a classic adventure game interface. There is absolutely no need to have played any of the previous Carol Reed games to fully enjoy Bosch's Damnation. The game starts with an interactive tutorial which explains how to play. And dont worry about getting stuck. The game features a hint system which you can consult any time. The game takes place in Sweden, but is in English. All dialogue has optional subtitles. The game contains no graphic violence or strong language. It has no action sequences, and is suitable for ages 15 and up. You can't die in the game.","“The bottom line is that Bosch's Damnation is a simple, beautiful, laid back game which will allow you to take a short vacation in Sweden.

1033,"OVIVO is a metaphoric game filled with illusions and hidden messages. In the world of OVIVO Black and White exist in harmony. Constantly intertwining and replacing each other they maintain balance. The main character named OVO created from these two halves of the world and it has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphoric world, overcomes various dangers and collects mysterious symbols. These symbols help you to unravel the story of this world but how you interpret it is completely up to you. Features: Flow mechanics. In white, the gravity force is directed downwards, in black - upward. Preservation of momentum while transitioning from one color to another allows OVO to float along their border as if it is carried by the flow. Fascinating art. The metaphorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions. Design without words. There is no text in the game and the story is narrated through gameplay and visuals. Symbolism and puzzles. The game is filled with allusions and hidden messages.

1048,"The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place is a short, interactive tale about a building eater consuming a tower on the edge of the town of Matsyapura. Using a blend of descriptive text and surrealist visuals it is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history. In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states. Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem titled : The Building Eaters of Matsyapur, he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the creation of a populace that is devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past. With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem. Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester. A site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix, Leicester. And at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.","“In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what can be done – if anything – to intervene.

Units are approximately company-sized. A challenging strategic problem Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle.

Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability.

1132,"Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online! Featuring Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players. Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City. Modes and options: Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.

1201,"Sometime in the late 2000s, Howard James Wright - an old but kind man - perishes. Leaving behind him many adventures, relics he's collected over the years as well as books authored, he is also leaving Sarah, his granddaughter behind. Having to shoulder the arduous task of clearing out her grandfathers attic, she is soon to find that not everything about her grandfathers attic is what it seems. What Never Was is a short, story-driven first-person game focused on exploration and puzzle-solving. You play as Sarah Elizabeth Wright, exploring through your grandfathers attic, solving small puzzles and uncovering the story through gameplay. What Never Was aims to combine the gameplay of classic point-and-click games with the control schemes of modern adventure and walking sim games. It is inspired by the likes of Myst, Indiana Jones and The Longest Journey and borrows themes from folklore, Norse mythology, and works from authors like H.P. Lovecraft. The game is the first solo game and passion project of game developer Acke Hallgren with the support of a handful of supportive creatives.","“Games like WHAT NEVER WAS are the reason why i love exploring indie games, you can see some truly great games made with a little budget. Definitely give WHAT NEVER WAS a shot it is worth the time.” Gameplay Review “This adventure game is a reminder of how enjoyable the genre can be with a good story.

You start your new settlement with the intention of turning post-apocalyptic land into working rocketry. So, you start by digging Wells which produce and propagate Water. Then you create Tilled Earth, which receives that Water and becomes Farmland, which in turn produces Food. You can build up your infrastructure to support solar farms and hydroponics labs to stock sleek generational ships that each rescue thousands of evacuees. Or, you can remain low-tech and brute force your population off the Earth by building massive numbers of 1960s era rocketry. And, that's T-Minus 30.

Mind you, however you play, you can't save everyone, and people will still end up dead. But that's life. Explore abandoned ruins of a once-bustling civilization. Mine skyscrapers and junkyards to reclaim plastics and metals. Explore procedurally generated landscapes, from small, arid maps with scarce resources to large, forested maps replete with ancient ruins.

1243,"Now with Chapter 1 and 2! Prepare for a story-driven campaign within the Sentinel Comics universe as you join forces with an ever-growing team of heroes to face a wide variety of villains. What seems like a typical bank heist reveals itself to be just the beginning of a much more sinister plan! Create your hero, gather your team, and save the world in this exciting new turn-based strategy! Build your Team - select from the many available heroes and unlock more throughout Full story campaign - writers and creators from Sentinel Comics Freeform movement - Turn Based game that allows you to move anywhere Squad dynamics - heroes or villains can work together for more powerful actions Living Environments - multiple objectives, interactions and dangers Create your Hero - choose backstory, archetype, powers, and appearance What kind of hero will you be? Custom Heroes Choose the character's backstory, personality, power source, abilities and costume. Heroes have 'stances' that provide boosts to certain stats like extra movement along with powerful sets of abilities and can be fully customized to fit your play style. Build your hero from 12 exciting themes - fill your stances with powerful abilities from any three: Power Melee - When you really want to hit someone really hard. Combos - Concentrate your attacks, spread 'em out, or bring a friend! Supportive - Whether protecting or attacking, the right move requires no planning. Blaster - Attack as many as you can in several different areas! Interceptor - Never let an enemy out of your sights and punish wrong moves. Minions - Disposable and endless, have your own minions fight for you! Gadgets - Deploy an arsenal of gadgets that eliminate all who oppose you. And more! Creating a superhero identity is more than a costume selection! Choose how your hero uses their abilities, different weapons, attack styles, and special effects; some themes even have different types of units that you can summon. Refine your heroic identity throughout the game - changing everything about how your hero looks, all the way down to your hero's body type, between any mission. Sync and Vigilance Actions Sync and Vigilance actions add life to the battlefield when characters perform additional actions out of sequence, triggered by special conditions. When a character performs an action, sync actions allow other characters to take part or enhance that action, like a character creating a distraction to remove the target's Evade defense before an attack lands. Positioning your team to take advantage of these extra actions can be critical to the success of a mission. Vigilance allows an inactive character to react to the active character based on various triggers, such as moving through their line of sight. Each character has a 'vigilance zone' around them which sets the chance of the vigilance action happening. These actions can go much further than the standard overwatch with actions like 'keep cover' which allows a character to try and find new cover when flanked. Large Scale Missions Players will embark on several missions throughout the campaign. These missions are broken up into groups of engagements - each offering unique objectives, enemy types and player choice on where to go next - keeping each feeling fresh and unique. Another benefit to these smaller engagements is that the player will not be overwhelmed by both the quantity of enemies and time for each turn. However, stringing all these engagements together still allows the player to feel like their heroes are very powerful as they dispatch lots of enemies throughout the mission. Initiative Will you be able to rescue the hostages in time? Can you survive the chaos until more defensive actions are taken? Initiative can have a major impact in situations like these. In Sentinels of Freedom, initiative determines the turn order for all characters and events in a round. Actions from previous rounds can have a major impact on initiative. A Swap mechanic allows hero to shift their position in the initiative order allowing more control over which hero to activate. The first hero in the initiative order receives a speed bonus while the last hero is awarded an accuracy bonus.","“Sentinels of Freedom Gameplay with Splat!

I loved this game from the minute I began playing and it only got better. Many times, TM games become a bit boring but not so with Hard to be a Queen. I loved the very funny dialog that pops up between the scenes. The tasks also kept me involved in the game. When I find a TM game like Royal Life Hard to be a Queen it is a keeper for me. The only thing that would make the game a bit better, IMHO, is if the icons for the inventory were larger. It was difficult for me to see how many resources I had available as the numbers were so tiny, particularly the ones on the side that indicated the bricks or other miscellaneous items I needed to collect in order to move forward. Aside from the small icons, the rest of the game is excellent. I love the graphics and, of course, the dialog that at times had me rolling on the floor. Royal Life Hard to be a Queen is a TM game that will keep me entertained for hours. Kudos to the developer for creating an excellent game that I think is one of the best that I have played this year.

Lead your tribe from the ground, immersed in the world while you shape it. Build towns and industry with complete freedom and control, from placing the tiniest pebble to constructing monumental structures. Start with nothing and advance through thousands of years of technological breakthroughs in this intimate yet expansive colony sim. Choose Your Home Pick from thousands of procedurally generated lands across a map larger than Earth itself. Choose wisely, as each area has different climates, resources, and challenges. Finding the right place to begin your home is key to growing your civilisation. Lead Your People Walk the paths beside your people as you lead them through this uncharted world. Instruct individual sapiens to focus on specific tasks, such as planting crops, gathering materials, building, hunting, cooking, and more. Watch as they learn new skills, making them more valuable to your tribe. Manage their moods, health, and support their growing families. Find Resources Find new resources and send your sapiens to investigate, leading to new breakthroughs which unlock new things to build and craft. Start with primitive materials and work your way up to using more advanced tools and techniques. Build A Civilization Build shelters, both to keep your sapiens happy and to preserve food and resources. Every wall, roof, seat or fireplace can be placed individually. Each tree, log, plank or rock can be removed or situated, and the terrain can be dug, mined or filled to shape the world the way you want. Expand Your Reach Send sapiens over long distances and establish camps to gather far away resources. Create transportation networks to bring those resources back to your base for processing or storage. Send a group to explore over great distances, or conduct a hunting mission. Take down a mammoth to feed and clothe your tribe for months, but know that you may lose some sapiens trying.

During World War II, the Russians deported by trains several hundred thousand people from Eastern Europe, including Poland to Siberia for work camps. You play as one of the displaced people. Our task is to escape from the train and survive in the Siberian taiga in Virtual Reality.","“I could hear men’s voices, and when I took a look around, I realized that I was inside the cattle wagon. Around the walls of the carriage were people in worn clothes. Through the half-open door, a blizzard raged outside. An inner voice spoke: “Maybe if the train slowed down, I would be able to escape.” I jumped out, landed in a snowdrift, and suddenly I was again in Jozwiak-Rodan’s cozy apartment. “I think history should be told in a way that young people can understand it,” he said as I put the virtual reality goggles and controllers on the desk. And so, he and his programmer friend Jacek Ross started developing the VR game Siberian Run in 2018. Immersed in a virtual Siberia, players take on the role of a fugitive trying to avoid capture. They can collect different objects that help on the quest and interact with the world around them.

1445,"The tide of Soviet power washing across the face of the Earth could possibly have been turned back at various stages of history. But the new energy sources they discovered lit a fire under the Russian war machine. So when Stalin rolled into Paris, the resulting flare-up of global conflict left little more than smoking ash heaps where America and Great Britain had been. Now, Stalin is dead. Though resistance movements have emerged, the Soviets still stand supreme as rulers of the globe. Only a force from beyond the earth could possibly tip the balance. Abram Krupin, leader of a resistance cell, knows this. When he sees a dog fall from the stars, then, he takes it as an omen. This dog speaks, wears silver armor, and has an arsenal of mysterious weapons. Abram calls her Laika. Laika believes that, despite all odds, she can protect the countless lives crushed by the Soviets. The Sun at Night is a 2D action platformer to be released in three parts. All episodes will feature: - Massive, nonlinear levels that model the layouts of real locations in a way not yet seen in other platformers - Large, choice-rich skill trees that let players approach the game the way they want to - A novel defensive mechanic that lets players turn the firepower of Laika's enemies against them - Smoothly flowing, fast-paced shooting action - A story of struggle and hope, full of twists and revelations - Rich, evocative art depicting a world dominated by a technologically ascendant Soviet empire - Secrets and rewards hidden in every corner for the determined player","“The Sun at Night is a video game and it wants you to know it...

1449,"More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum.

Play as the Pumpkin and absorb damage with the Thorn Shield, or choose the Skeleton Wizard and keep your distance while dealing damage from afar. Collect coins to spend in the shop, or kill Elites and collect rare items to assist you along the way. Battle through six increasingly difficult levels, and destroy Nexrolis to avenge the life that he took away from you. Floors of Discomfort combines the best of three different worlds to give one awesome experience. We have drawn from the roguelike idea of procedural generation and permadeath, making Floors of Discomfort feel different every time it is played. We have taken from platformers by adding simple platforming like gameplay, giving a different feel to what might be expected from a game like FoD. We have drawn from action games, making Floors of Discomfort a very fast paced, challenging, experience that will keep you on your toes the entire run. These three aspects come together to create a game that offers a unique experience that is both rewarding, and satisfying.",6.5/10 – Co-Op Couple,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/header.jpg?t=1447374965,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4f420cc0b695474101d498a1548432a024e91454.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_d7dea9e2e860e5106ec7cc426debeb052621dcb7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4fadedf78c2febc4570bc0161e06b7e330c6c4c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4db382f9078eee4c570d73572e1eba3bf261348a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_cf197c5bfdc433b55afdbb4d0f26f99081ceac7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_915a05cd832938cec1bbce4f386b4d5fa0f01852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965","Action,Indie,RPG"

In normal difficulty we control the donut in the classic way of a platform game. In addition to the normal difficulty, we have created a difficulty challenge that changes the controller completely. It offers a clever system of rockets allowing you to move forward, but despite its outward simplicity, it remains a challenging way of maneuvering through the game world. Activate the right rocket at the right time. Otherwise, you risk going the wrong way. Advance through the levels to save Mr. Mug, collect sugar canisters. You will then be able to unlock and play the famous hidden donuts. The chronometer mode is built so that you can improve your rocket control in the best possible way. In this mode you will be able to get different medals by beating the bronze, silver and then gold ghosts. Finally, this is where you will be able to see the best times of your friends and the world. Challenge the rankings if you feel you can! For the most reckless players among you, a mode where the floor is lava is available! Finish an environment for the first time to unlock its 'Floor is Lava' mode where touching the flaming floor instantly cooks your donut. Each level in this mode is different from its original version and cannot be finished in the same way. And it's also the opportunity to catch even more sugar canisters!","“What follows is a puzzle-y platformer that takes cues from Trials, Team 17 and the works of Bennett Foddy.

1590,"Just Ski is a challenging, minimalist, physics driven game that will frustrate and punish you in the beginning but reward you with the feeling of mastery in the end. The Controls The controls for Just Ski are borrowed from an old, abandoned game called Ski Stunt Simulator. Your only control over the skier is to move your mouse down to make him crouch or up to make him extend. It's a very simple to understand mechanic but requires a healthy amount of practice to master. The key to success with Just Ski is learning to control your rotation while in the air. It's all about gaining a feel for the conservation of angular momentum: crouch to spin faster, extend to spin slower. Your Goal Just ski to the cabin. Learning Curve Like learning to ride a bike, Just Ski is going to feel clunky and impossible in the beginning, but once mastered will feel smooth and rewarding with just the right amount of challenge to keep things interesting. -Have fun and thanks for playing!","“Just Ski is incredibly difficult.

1591,"SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy. The current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot. See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for an FAQ and links to more information. If you're wondering where the MacOS X port went, see that FAQ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags, but the non-Steam MacOS will continue to work, and I'll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully!","“There has never been a videogame like SpyParty. … SpyParty is as cerebral and personal experience as I’ve ever had with a multiplayer game. … Despite being two years away from completion, the early version I saw still remains one of the most subtle, enjoyable, and surprisingly playful multiplayer games I’ve yet played.” Destructoid “Part of what is so exciting about Spy Party is the stuff that happens around the game. Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it… guilt of all things. I’ve killed thousands — millions? — of enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker’s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized I was wrong. I felt bad.” Kotaku “SpyParty is like nothing else I’ve ever played. … When the laser focuses on you, the tension is intense.

1682,"Something Ate My Alien is a 2D, digging and puzzle platformer game where you take the role of the AI Antalasia, and control your little Alien blobs to explore the planets you visit! Your task is to dig through the ground of the different worlds and find all the items required by the pirate that is hijacking you. During the adventure on each planet you have to battle environmental dangers, fight off wildlife, solve secret puzzle chambers, and all this while surviving on a depleting oxygen supply and a threat far scarier than the local wildlife. Key Features Dig through the depths of 4 different planets and collect as much loot as possible. Solve puzzle chambers by pushing and pulling blocks to reveal secret treasures. Survive by finding oxygen recharge stations and dodging environmental obstacles. Fight the hostile flora and fauna with your choice of 6 specialized weapons. Upgrade and build your equipment by collecting items and energy. Find hidden relics and collect achievements. Engage in bigger battles with the scary huge threats guarding the hidden secrets. DIG Guide the Aliens to find all the resources the pirate demands, and any additional items you find you can use to build upgrades. Some planets are rich in gems, others in specific minerals, fossils, artefacts or gases. Collect as much as you can! SOLVE PUZZLES Each planet has an array of puzzle chambers that once solved reveals hidden treasures. Pull and push the blocks into the correct positions to get the tokens containing parts of the code you need to unlock new places and move your adventure forward. SURVIVE Your Aliens need to survive in the perilous environments while digging and exploring. Find oxygen recharge stations and beware of pools of corrosive, super heated or poisonous substances, falling rocks, slippery ice, toxic gases and open flames. FIGHT There are 6 unique weapons all with different mechanics to defend yourself against the abundant flora and fauna. Look out for charging animals, flying creatures, armoured beasts and be careful walking underneath hanging fungi. UPGRADE Use the items the pirate doesn't want to build new upgrades for the Aliens. What should you pick? Faster mining? Better guns? Bigger oxygen tanks? Longer lasting jet packs? Or perhaps something else to aid your Aliens while exploring the caves? THE BIGGER THREAT The same alien race that left behind a maze of locked teleporters and the hidden codes to unlock them also left behind something very dangerous to guard it all, a fail safe.

1772,"THE DRAGON'S LEGACY The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this 'being?' deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr. GAMEPLAY You, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself. That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight. Through 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay. You will also fall under the spell of 'The I of the Dragon' with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring. FEATURES A choice of three dragons each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon.

1819,"Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered. This game is over three years old now, and I've appreciated every individual fan! You all mean the world to me, and who knows? You might want to keep an eye out for something special very soon!","“simple yet charming RPG” Recommended – Talonphobia “Love this kind of unique RPG maker stuff, it's why I love the genre so much.” Recommended – WillDaBeard “This game is really enjoyable, it's funny and actually has a nice plot.” Recommended – karma",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/header.jpg?t=1609041145,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_3c4715a4318ebc11e7b6072e7ee36aa62befcb16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_cf83a7a4f5d119125225ca39c5a336dd10a348b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_fa3810d1fd71a43b2d43f1a459f2fce6dda7c9b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_3b2afad4f5cc322a979addbe3f70428df0a74e33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_9e9372c0924896edf4d77711678a0cd01d4b03e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/659260/ss_230eba1cc5cddb660b2b893e4927e751dbc9d240.1920x1080.jpg?t=1609041145","Adventure,Indie,RPG"

1859,"An afternoon spent walking between the gravestones reading the whispers of those that have passed. This is the experience Boon Hill promises to give. A graveyard simulator, with all the adventure of exploring a real graveyard without looking like a creeper. To put it as simply as possible, Boon Hill is a game about reading gravestones. There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again. Free Roaming The game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines. No Danger The game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you. Though they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard. Discover Mystery In the Graveyard Boon Hill is not aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations. The threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone. The specifics of what you can expect from Boon Hill: Fancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago. The ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive. Well over a thousand individual graves and epitaphs! It's the whole point of the game, after all. Several NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Crows! The graveyard has a lot of crows. It's as much a feature as anything else. Figure out what's up with that weird goth chick!

1960,"PRiO is a visually-striking, yet challenging platformer about manipulating the environment around you. To complete a stage, you must light up all the blocks in a level. The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.","“sharp gameplay that’s right at the sweet-spot between too tough and too easy” Indie Game Magazine “PRiO is punishing, but in the best possible way” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/header.jpg?t=1478028084,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_79ccab4e49d954efce2fa70da483d7a52f29053a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_536bb4fdca229cc1a7ab65687341aa0052558b6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_6da76fe06e8ea30723eb371b47a5e43ca38513dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_a5911b9a3df6318a5a5ae4dd5a583afea1f3861b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_2806fe65917768d21e8a4165c6f213c2f2c88437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_45518e5f667c5fb4d5a4efcbba69d3cb87b1248d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_972e56577c519056e1c54dc53db25d970e9e6b1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_add9cf6e0e090c946512879934b88d8ac02ca983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084","Action,Adventure,Indie"
1963,"My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story of the cursed doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits of the little girl and the Devil. Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted. However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now. Key Features: Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal. Demons are lurking in the shadows. Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions. Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations. Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation. Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, character design, and programming except for the music.
