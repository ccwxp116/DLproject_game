20,"The Space Between is a surreal short narrative experience in three acts about the walls we build for us. The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other, they visit the theater's building site. While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about closeness and separation begins. The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience, that should be played in one sitting.","“The Space Between is deliriously uneasy in its final moments, thanks, in large part, to a skin-crawlingly stellar score.” Wireframe “The Space Between's Martin is afraid of intimacy, which is a lot like being terrified of death. Fearing intimacy is almost always about fearing loss. (...)

35,"A Guidebook of Babel is a story-adventure game based on the butterfly effect. It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase! You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel! If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel! From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures! You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force! Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation! Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook. It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain! The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation. Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!","“A Guidebook Of Babel seems to be fanciful and open-minded, but the gameplay is quite mature and the plot is practical and interesting enough. Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, 'Babel' obviously handles both the 'storytelling' and 'puzzle solving' parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then 'A Guidebook Of Babel' is definitely worth watching.” 8.2 – Gamersky “Due to the game's dynamic and fluid design, the surprises of A Guidebook Of Babel will always be endless - every time you think the previous level is foolproof, the next level will immediately break your illusion, telling you that you need to observe carefully, and the story is far less simple than you think. Reverse, reverse and reverse, you can never guess where the story is going, and even if the player has the perspective of God, it will be like being in a mountain, but not seeing the mountain.” 3DM “These things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops. It was also after reading the whole story that I realized that A Guidebook Of Babel is not just a story about a book and a ship, but also a story about the boat maker.” 游研社",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/header.jpg?t=1691389011,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_3f1d7b20597e608191747fd976d7087a8d791a11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_959b248bcbd8774b5ad0097dd1e8bf70af563e0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_9526dcdf81461eb05938951a983c6e969a238d23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5a1d9100408c22aa29d9eaaa9f40aba32cecbd86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_5e9e3afec130dc8523b89ec2ef7d6f2745b13e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ed6e7aa76010e68f17e792bcfd98f50f96150c3f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_29d12518ad31e00e5a93d1173d0142fb834393f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7faef5ff0d0ea38a04595558cfb38ca35d25f8de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_10f361c2988ce772846f56981d2094f3f81bf96c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_7212d5aaf311c52643743a490527794caf969ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_d5bf1c2127b82ca45d1f81dd6ea58fb9d3ebe364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_ef320cad58168822bbaec341baae49e587155632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_1f4b4db9b38177f3f6a4b7bbc7ba742f757dba87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1467920/ss_efbe3f7ccf39d48306082c4d212ff285b8dca582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1691389011","Adventure,Indie"

Strategies must be divined with care, and constantly modified to ride the chaotic rapids of the thousands of interactive elements in this opus of creative genius. Perhaps. Or it could just be a damn fine game.” 95 – Amiga Format “Colonization offers hours and hours of entertainment. I played it for over a week to write this review and it commanded my total concentration all the time to play it once through. Because the game can be very different every time you play it, this means that Colonization is the sort of game you could play for ever.” 93 – Amiga Power “'Go and make a world', they said. 'Do it by Wednesday night', they said. 'And bring us back some chips'. Colonization is a fairly simple idea in theory but, thankfully, much more involved once you get going.

On your adventure, you will find common, rare and legendary cards. Don't forget: You will always need your physical cards to cast spells in Malkyrs. Evolution Because Malkyrs is both physical and digital, each card can be traded like with a traditional card game.

Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations. Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world. Key Features: Take on the Gorg in more than 40 challenging levels of revolutionary tower defense action. Satellites in orbit replace the towers and grid layout used in other tower defense games. Move your satellites around their orbits to create the best defense for each wave. Experience a thrilling story inspired by the classic sci-fi films of the 1950s.

Also, players must use basic attacks, skills, and items' active effects to defeat enemies. Get items through exploration Players can explore unknown lands to acquire dozens of distinctive items. Items are divided into 'rune stones', which combine weapons and use effects, and general items which provide basic lasting effects and experience bonuses.

Each aircraft type has four skills, and from the second skill, they will be unlocked upon defeating boss monsters that you encounter during the game. Skills You can only select one of two skills for each stage, but you can change your choice at any time. You need smarts and a good gamer mind to change your skills according to the situation, whether it be the terrain or enemy type! Unleashing Potential ASCENXION has a main character with some great power sealed inside. Of course, this great power can be unleashed. By completing an event that you will inevitably encounter during the game, you can unleash this power, and when this power is unleashed, modifications are made to its skills and overall stats that suit an aircraft of such great power.

414,"Ted by Dawn is a humor laden throwback to classic action platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid. The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. There are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success. On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.","“Step aside Dead Rising, for Ted By Dawn is the new zombie flick in town. It combines side-scrolling platform style movement with undead slaying action, and it’s hilarious. Basically, you’ve got to fight the undead, while dodging giant razor baldes and/or fire and work your way towards bosses. It sounds unplayable, I know, but you’ll be relieved to hear that you are given a chainsaw, and a motorcycle at points. I can imagine those bits aren’t so hard. The most annoying parts aren’t the deaths form zombies or giant bosses though, it’s the unexpected deaths from sneakily placed barbed logs.

422,"What is Math Classroom Challenge? Math Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In the game the player never loses. There is simply a parameterizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much. Math Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.","“Math Classroom Challenge is a excellent (iOS) app for learning basic Math skills (i.e. additions, subtraction, etc.).” Apps Gadget “Math Street Challenge, the augmented version of Math Classroom Challenge” Arbrettspiele",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/header.jpg?t=1621066677,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dc61bb8254149c4b3a93948018d4d016cc9ed234.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bedf34ae3608b35f65e2f41e1e658b9694a7252b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_dfdabd155bb40b7843e2ce2de12eddedfb7f2dcd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_cdc7b2a032590480dca5375b8632e676fa2b8fec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6c9a04ffec68682ad3c5733530e7193de33a7412.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_bb7c433f20432b5cffe78e7742bf348af72a65c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_070f3c83c3531131781fb8208a179db3dd64a490.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_e355a1755711b64df1a4aa734e2f50ee19837774.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_366170220ffbf8f42110bb33c9ae205f44571680.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_6e2d26827ad6aeecc8831833b1f723d70b68639b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_71c973c3a9e52ce8ed02bc9b16987467acf56979.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_f965ece43d8cea8fb9e012e1ee63e70e73112631.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_33ff08bfa379b2a1dcf451d461d90512290b0cbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_15029f5d78fc6619ae1eef55012e63a267aa554c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_9e052ffb0510615a5f00452ab6874175e0558eb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_94baa09916a4c6dd57c730d3efceb1d6f0f84fed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/859970/ss_04072a18613c3bdc17f00b9172bcc0edd77011b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621066677","Casual,Indie"

Experience this fusion of East and West, old and new, in a game meant to surpass Stegosoft Games' previous work in every way! STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total.

Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart. So did the people. They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too worn by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven successful. The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable.

431,"Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator. Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask. The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper. Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia. Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort. All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health. Always contact a specialist!","“Plague M.

This simulation focuses on stunning architectural spaces and texture transitions. The perfect break from all those action packed games out there. Warning : This game purposely has no saving system. The experience should be done in one walk-through. Take your time. Close the curtains and use headphones. Gameplay The game starts with a 10 minute intro. After the intro you are given control and able to start moving around in the environment. Take your time in exploring the various spaces and music.,"“It’s a work which seems intimately concerned with the fragility of the self in relation to the other: tensions between the two permeate every surface of the game’s inhuman and often uncomfortably alien spaces, and always, there is the sense that at any moment, everything is on the verge of folding in on itself — less an act of momentous collapse than a slow but certain erasure through erosion.” Spencer Yan - Medium “...a fulfilling experience that does something to move the chains for video games in a general sense. It’s a game that got me thinking about hardness and softness, opaqueness and transparency, accessibility and total obtuseness.” Cameron Kunzelman - Waypoint “Fugue in Void is a great game and a great representative of its genre, so if you like the genre, you will also like the game.” MASKINKULTUR",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/header.jpg?t=1648476239,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_77e0026c81e7ba58c30d12a644f32dfb0c370f0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_fdae867ec7d5a681eeb152fadfc9f306819a51f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_3c991d5f2509edb76278e3b058b92e9417a04d91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_21045db629d58e899bea81a7853029d8a112e958.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/883220/ss_46254458cb98b1eb9460e8b3d9d0ac8bed450242.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648476239","Casual,Indie,Simulation"

Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel. And it cannot possibly go wrong. In theory. Seconds into its maiden voyage it crashes into hyperspace, vanishes... and collides with your house. Bewildered, you find your way aboard, and just as you are gazing at its awe-inspiring interior, the ship takes off again and heads deep into space. You are stranded. But you are not alone... The ship is inhabited by a crew of malfunctioning robots and a semi-deranged parrot. You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters-Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortilian Bantoburn O'Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot. Talk to them, interrogate them. Give them orders. They will listen to you, answer you and, if they happen to feel like it, obey you. Sometimes. To begin with you are a third-class passenger, and you quickly find yourself in the grip of one of the most powerful forces known to man-the desire for a free upgrade. As you move up to second and, at last, to first class, more and more of the ship becomes accessible to you, and more and more of its mysteries are revealed. What has happened here? What terrible events occurred the night before the launch? Who is the mysterious Titania whose brooding statues dominate the ship? Can you solve a series of increasingly bizarre and surreal puzzles., unlock the central mystery and return to Earth before the parrot drives you finally and irrevocably mad?

531,"FIREWORKS MANIA is an explosive simulator game where you can play around with fireworks. In various low-poly environments you can go nuts with all the fireworks you want. Eventhough the game is created to be a casual game where players just have fun for a short while, the game can easily entertain creative players for hours, as they setup a firework show or explore the environments in the hunt for things to blow up. Not two play-sessions are the same, as the game is heavily physics based, resulting a different outcome every time.

560,"Triple Town is an award-winning original puzzle game in which you try to grow the greatest possible city. The larger the city you build, the more points you score. You build your city by matching three or more game-pieces: combine three grasses to make a bush, three bushes to make a tree... until you've filled the board with houses, cathedrals and castles. Along the way, you'll have to outwit giant bears who will try to block your progress. How large can you grow your dream city before the board fills and the game ends? This is the ultimate hardcore version of Triple Town. There are no in-app purchases of any kind in the game. There is no DLC.

774,"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.","“A small but perfectly formed puzzle game about building tiny cities on even tinier boards that keeps you coming back for more” Rock, Paper and Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/header.jpg?t=1700728966,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_105fb55657cb3afe319b0b897bec433ce1d1253f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_ae1b4330e539d3571909fdb467c8c09d3ffd098a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4dad8497edbbbd4f93c9a15bc9a02870ec2b277f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_f0119350752c29572124a569ff5abecc33e7b4c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fd188b47ed458f3870cf33b6728455efaa2d4353.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b2ab251ed4b3110114febafd7c9d1b2b028a7dfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_4ee3c1d8a6689cb14b6d35f6aa1a039e2dc14423.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b37b85ff27fe5d0452d192618ea82544326c2e77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_72d4f99b77bb64acdb2f257ef6283a6c2a3b8e9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_288827feb003654057ac1ab3e7c80ab22ed8d299.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_e8bb0fdf7a761e4ef72b0fd5cc15ad8d2a8aabc0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_b95734f5bc5ccb3bc37f831df01ffcacc86e782d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_48317c0c289aad73ac7b0a328cbe813a037ef38c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5531a761b3d21bd89c20273f296b8a42ba3e467b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_5a6f818ee450d3dadf10bfd29811d18fd7a38a6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_fb8b7cbd569da3d0cf48a879a421404d09d2b30d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_a65ff231a970f0dade53d4c87ce1d559ebc5ac12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_d8383fdd037bf81ab0f0f369a31a9670fc3c8b97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_8a18e68b7e789ed112720df5089a67859cff5add.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_532f4630e3b5bacd4309f35ab52b34338b7a3b89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2141770/ss_989e8572b7894373d4d1f1fa2661870a1ad83f68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1700728966",Strategy

The surviving angels and demons gather at the city they believe to be their final chance at salvation: the floating purgatory of 'Tokyo Babel'. Joined by humans, they embark on a pilgrimage across the seven layers of Babel, hoping to ascend Jacob's Ladder in an effort to re-open the gates of Heaven. Their journey would be an atonement toward the heavens. And yet, their plans fall into ruin as a group of pilgrims - their minds consumed by madness - set out to lord over the numerous layers of Tokyo Babel with the intention to wreak complete and utter havoc atop the floating purgatory. Amidst this neverending impasse, a lone youth is saved from the ruins of his devastated world - Tendou Setsuna, a man denied human treatment since birth. Joining his savior, Lilith - known as the Witch of the Night, he begins his journey across Tokyo Babel... ...yearning for an answer to a single question: Why he still possesses the will to keep on living.","“This is a full priced release from MangaGamer, at $34.95, and in my opinion, it is definitely deserving of the premium.

Those who refused were exiled to the island of Fleece, to live unhindered, yet disconnected from the rest of the 'enlightened' world. By 2030 all the Earth was claimed.

As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.

They need your guidance to survive the events foretold by the Prophecy, so make sure your Pips work hard! Dotage has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games. Build your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources. Take your time and think carefully before passing the turn! The memories of the Elder are unclear, so each run will be different, with new buildings to discover. Play with more than 200 buildings, 30 professions, and 70 resources. As you play, the memories of the Elder will come back, unlocking new game mechanics and content, such as new ailments, the mysterious VIPs, and new Elders! Each turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village. From poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse? In addition to each run being different, the game has multiple difficulty levels, so pick the one that suits your playstyle. Enjoy a relaxed turn-based town builder with its cozy graphics, or prove your mastery of the prophecy with the increasingly difficult mastery levels!

1028,"KING MAN! Retro KING MAN! Super KING MAN! Three classics from the past are celebrating a glorious return, bringing you all new features, modern tweaks and the soul of the late 80s and early 90s in one funny package! KING MAN Released back in 1988, KING MAN quickly became a favorite among 8-bit gamers, due to its silly humor, catchy music and clever level design. Paving the way for future installments, this single screen puzzle platformer impressed with its high quality graphics and mind-twisting levels. Retro KING MAN Released in 1990, Retro KING MAN changed the gameplay quite a bit, as players could explore large maps to find upgrades for the KING MAN. Without knowing it at that time, this game featured many ideas that would become a staple of metroidvania and platformer gamedesign in the years to come. Super KING MAN Released in 1992, Super KING MAN brought the titular hero to a new generation of fans, with even sillier humor and over the top voice samples. The game was groundbreaking for its full-screen pixelation effects, the use of widescreen and iconic voice acting. Rounding out this spectacular package is a documentary about the full history of the series, how it started and how it all fell apart. Experience and enjoy these wonderful classics from an era that never was for the first time since their original release and dive into the world of the KING MAN - metaphorically, of course. ------------------------------- Controller Information: This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads. However, due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard.

1044,"Survive the zombie apocalypse with turn-based combat and permanent death! Manage survivors, go on dangerous scavenging runs, build alliances, craft equipment, make difficult story-influencing decisions, defend your camp against undead hordes and experience non-linear rogue-lite elements. An innovative Indie Survival-RPG! Just after the zombie outbreak you were fortunate enough to join a group of survivors and hole up in their camp. But that doesn't set you out of danger! Food supplies are running low, injured survivors must be tended to and materials need to be scavenged to keep the camp intact. The zombie threat increases steadily and gangs of hostile survivors keep you on the defensive. Every survivor should be protected because you'll need all hands on deck to defend against the dangers of the apocalypse. Scavenge supplies in zombie-infested areas, craft survival gear and buy and sell equipment to keep yourself and your camp members alive long enough to learn the skills necessary for long-term survival. The combat system has its roots in classic role-playing games. You can fight strategically, learn to utilize various weapon types and use a range of bombs or traps. Should you fail to survive the apocalypse, you can purchase upgrades with medals earned in previous playthroughs to give your new character an edge to start with. Unlocked pre-apocalypse professions of your character allow you to specialize in various jobs. Each new playthrough offers different random missions and survivors to meet. A praised feature of Dead Age is its non-linear story with real in-game consequences. Decisions you make in conflict situations affect the story's future. You can choose to be a hero and save more survivors, or let them die to stock up on supplies. You can build romance relationships with other survivors or start rivalries that may have disastrous chain reactions. Daily events offer new dangers and situations in which you must make choices that affect the survival chances of your camp. Live long enough, and you'll have a chance to unlock one of the game's six possible endings.",“Dead Age is a surprising and fresh Survival RPG that finally does something different - and amazingly good.” One4U “Dead Age is a terrific genre mix” Games-Mag “Dead Age is a must have for any RPG fan who has always hoped for a post-apocalyptic theme” 7/10 – OPNOOBS,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/header.jpg?t=1649421941,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_60d4fdaa78dc45ab78eb7d6d41a27435d5d8d527.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_4fbbac55b51e5a1a947ff44e2a745d18a45f7910.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_b0816cb3d9c59c3e2c7200e81695c0c1644092fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_47600d5bad1d75f39bcdfed34bac469d25a9ffff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_cf33c179616f84cb1da4468d93f65205ba68e156.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_3fcc96b02b2cdb60e26312de2a7952168646f189.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_60b625466e908308984fa22110a09126680b65a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/363930/ss_0896cb12bdd356981e57b5500614779495d987b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421941","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy"

Episodes Each Episode is considered to be a stand-alone experience. Any future Episodes will expand upon Lethe's lore and backstory, but not necessarily the same protagonist's story. Story Crushed under the debts of his recently deceased step-father, Robert Dawn, a journalist with an unremarkable career, decides to hunt down his origins. Everything points to a quiet mining settlement. Shortly after his arrival, Robert comes into contact with an unknown substance and develops psychokinetic abilities that feed on his life energy. As tension rises, he is faced with another, even darker threat, quickly turning the trip into a terrifying battle for survival. Features Stealth Gameplay: Run or hide to survive. Psychokinesis: Manipulate the environment and use it in your aid. But be careful! Your newly gained abilities can only affect inorganic objects. Quality Graphics: Immerse yourself in a highly detailed and horrifying world. Story: Lethe isn't your typical adventure game.

Designed for all generations it contains missions with nice and colorful enemies while focused on the arcade element of the gameplay. This being said, this is an upfront disclaimer about a lot of repetitiveness in the gameplay as it is the case with older arcade games. You dive into deep space escorting a cargo ship from your fleet. Quickly you realize you're within the boundaries of enemy territory. Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself. Victory doesn't come easy as you have to earn every single space credit out there fighting in over 50 missions. By clearing your mission objectives, reward is coming to your account and you're ready to upgrade your ship with decoys, shields, laser boosters and much more. You can even buy a new, better fighter. As you progress, you will get engaged in trading earned resources such as cobalt, nickel, palladium and others in trading room every space station features. Build your strategy by carefully choosing routes from your space station towards another and have your take in every mission. Each mission will pit a challenge in front of you and most of the missions will get you to face a bigger and badder alien ships.","“The retro trend in video games remains strong, but not many of these love letters to old school gaming could pass for an actual retro game release.

1449,"More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum.

1550,"You are the glass eye of a very forgetful explorer. Deep inside an ancient ruin, somewhere in a lost world behind the Bermuda Triangle known as the World of Clouds, you were removed and left behind all alone. Now you must uncover the secrets of the maze and find a way out by yourself. EyeRoll is extremely simple and relaxing to play. You are rolling a glass eye through a maze and must uncover secrets and solve puzzles to find your way out. It is recommended you play with a mouse that has a scroll wheel since you can use that to move the follow camera closer to objects of interest in order to study them so they can serve as clues as to how to find a way out of the maze. It is perfectly suitable for a person of any age and is safe and enjoyable for very young children. The movements of the glass eye player character in the game is purely physics driven. It can bounce around, jump, spin and bump into things. It is controlled using the WASD keys and space bar for jumping. The player looks through a single follow camera with a semi top down view on the glass eye and field of view can be adjusted by moving the camera in closer or further away from the eye. So you could set how much your see of the maze yourself and in doing so challenge yourself accordingly. Look carefully at sigils and markings on objects since they hold clues. Avoid patches of sand.

Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a 'unique' technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character. Key Features 12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager. Drive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent.

1586,"Year 1442, Unified Calendar The world has been plunged into a devastating state of chaos, as two mighty powers wage war for supremacy. The Vollcross Empire, a brutal fascist regime, has launched a surprise invasion of the Kazanov Union, intent on eradicating the perceived communist threat. In the early days of the war, the Empire's forces were unstoppable, crushing opposition with ruthless efficiency. But as the Union mobilized its vast population and fought back, the Empire's supply lines began to falter, and the once certain victory began to slip away. The fate of the war now rests on Khaligrad, a key city that holds the precious oil fields both sides desperately need. The Union forces have dug in and are putting up fierce resistance, turning the battle into a brutal and prolonged conflict. Welcome to a place where war is the only truth, where victory is the only option. Welcome to the front, officer. Choose your side Khaligrad offers you 2 challenging campaigns. Will you fight for the Empire, a formidable invader with limited supplies and distant support? Or will you stand with the Union, the motherland boasting vast armies but struggling with inferior equipment? Face the Men...

You will lead several squads of soldiers of various quality and morale in a turn-based tactical battle. Ambush your opponents and use the terrain to your advantage to ensure victory. Urban guerrilla warfare is no easy playground. ... and the War In Khaligrad, the greatest adversary is not the enemy, but the harshness of war itself.

Tell your own story Depending on your successes and failures during the campaign, your story evolves and takes different directions. The missions entrusted to you by your HQ evolve accordingly.

1587,"40 miles under the Earth's surface, a hazardous research and refinery facility has faulted. Attempts to raise communication with the installment have failed. The status of all fifteen workers stationed within the facility is unknown. Valvorta Industries, the controversial energy corporation responsible for the site, must maintain discretion. In response, Valvorta's BoD has elected to dispatch an engineering specialist to assess the situation. The mission is simple: recover information, restore output from the facility and rescue the workers trapped under earth. Traversal through the facility will not be easy. The malfunctioning systems have made the descent near impossible. The high temperatures and the lack of breathable oxygen require the use of a specialized suit. You'll need a sharp eye to find any tools, lifts, documentation, and devices scattered across the facility, and a bright mind to put them to use. Extra attention must be paid to maintaining your suit's battery and air levels if you wish to survive. To make your mission easier, your suit provides a gauge on your current status, a log of any documents you find scattered about, magnetic boot attachments function for situational vertical and upside-down movement, and an instant connection to all terminals requiring rudimentary programming skills. Find whatever information you can and piece together the events leading to the loss in communications. After that, it will be up to you to decide what needs to be done.","“The highlights of the game for me are the a-ha moments.

Think of the first time you grabbed a controller and played as a character who rampaged through a world, killing everything in sight. Have you ever stopped to think how those little guys felt? Well now it's time for some payback! Kill The plumber is a parody to other platformers. Your goal is to stop the 'protagonist' from winning each level. You start off as a slow minion who can't even jump, but has enough power to kill the hero. As you get the hang of it, you start playing as other enemies that can jump, shoot, stomp and even fly, sometimes controlling more than one character at a time! It was a peaceful day in the kingdom, when all of a sudden a plumber decided to construct pipes everywhere and cause destruction. No matter what the critters throw at him, he kept coming back, and even tried to kidnap their princess.

1772,"THE DRAGON'S LEGACY The world of Nimoa is as beautiful as the morning dew, but only at first glance. Under the surface of hills and fertile valleys lurks an old and eternal evil. Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this 'being?' deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr. GAMEPLAY You, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself. That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight. Through 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon's individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay. You will also fall under the spell of 'The I of the Dragon' with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring. FEATURES A choice of three dragons each with its own abilities, based on fire, ice and acid, developing either into a battle, wizard or sniper dragon. There are no limits to the possibilities 12 unique territories representing various geographical areas: mountains desserts, forests and savanna etc. Each map has over 10 square kilometers to cover More than 60 spells with special effects available to each dragon Real time Terra-Forming allows complete mountain ranges disappear and reappear in another location Static and real-time lighting ensure the correct lighting conditions to every day and night cycle Fascinating sunsets and a night sky full of stars await you The Time Control-Option makes it possible to adjust 'The I of The Dragon' to your own speed Slow motion mode with a fascinating effect","“Very good!

1893,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.",“...
