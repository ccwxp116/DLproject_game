127,"THERE SWINGS A SKULL The town of Pareildas stands in the center of a vast desert. Its citizens live their lives quietly. Or, at least, they once did. In recent days the speaker-gallows sprang, weedlike, in the heart of the town - and since its inception the denizens of Pareildas have been sacrificed, one by one. The electric words that spew from the gallows claim this is to staunch the blistering hatred of the vengeful sun... but the heat has only grown more and more unbearable. OUR PROTAGONISTS Anatoli works for the town train station. He dreams of leaving Pareildas, so that he might peacefully live out the rest of his life with his husband. His dreams share much in common with the blackened husks of the town's denizens that line the streets. Pyotr is an independent artist. He hopes, deeply, that he might do something to stop the hellfire slowly consuming Pareildas. But the price of stopping the natural order is immensely steep - and, of course, there's no guarantee this is a natural occurrence at all... ABOUT THE GAME There Swings a Skull: Grim Tidings is a narrative-horror game built in RPG Maker 2003 by Conor Walsh and Quinn K., with music by Leaf Let. Though the game initially released as a jam game it was so well-received - and sat so well with our team - that we decided to build it out into a full game. Conor Walsh is a professional narrative designer who has written on such titles as The Outer Worlds, A Place, Forbidden, The DreadX Collection 2, and many others. Quinn K. brought indie darling OFF to the English-speaking world and recently released the stylish and moody AN OUTCRY. We hope you enjoy our work. FEATURES A deep central narrative Gorgeous pixel and fullscreen graphics A unique, haunting soundtrack Two separate routes and a third that we dare not mention Multiple endings A hateful sun The endless ocean Death","““THERE SWINGS A SKULL” has found its very own formal language to draw attention to the brutality of the climate catastrophe. Medium and long-term effects such as droughts and heat waves are represented here by a merciless sun that can literally pulverize people. This narrative sledgehammer is countered by the individual characters and their interaction with the world. In a short time, players witness how people stop dreaming, how they project their fears and how their facades crumble in the face of impending doom. All this happens in such a poetic way that it makes you ache.” The Game Curator “All of this surreal oddity and foreboding doom gives There Swings a Skull a very different feel from most horror games.... the town is the monster – a horrifying sun-baked purgatory that has no escape.

168,"Ardus Sheridan and his apprentice John Marrow are negotiators for the dream commodities company Powell-Mercer and have been sent to the seaside city of Ordolus in order to finalize a contract with the region's most recently discovered logomancer, Glenton Dahl. The story starts there as the duo reaches the city limits. What is the nature of the dreamworld that everyone is connected to? What is the true nature of logomancy? Is the emotion felt for a fictional character different from the emotion felt for a real person? Did the ancient peoples of Callosum like slow-roasted brisket? The Logomancer is a JRPG without killing. Conflicts are resolved through argumentation, logical discourse and persuasive speech. Mastering the elements of rhetoric will allow you to make your point to even the most stubborn audience. The people you meet are your 'weapons' and the skills they teach your 'magic'. Why not befriend an old editor and learn about the power of Proofreading? Or assist a schizophasic blacksmith to learn how to Doublespeak? In the world of the Logomancer, everyone is connected to a communal dreamworld known as the Mindscape. During sleep, everyone interacts together inside this strange mental world. The mind is a powerful tool in the world of dreams and the few exceptional individuals with the ability to build dreamworlds for others to participate in are called Logomancers. Using the classical elements of persuasion, social interactions become rhetorical battles. A 'boss fight' could just be trying to convince a store owner to give you a new suit free of charge. This means that stats like 'persuasion', 'confidence', and 'elocution' are much more important than 'strength', 'dexterity', or 'magic attack'. If you've ever wanted to play a Final Fantasy 6-styled JRPG wherein you could improve your characters' Perspicacity, then this game is probably for you. The Logomancer draws inspiration from the following sources, so if any of these pique your interest, there's a good chance there's something for you in this game: The Lost Room, Inception, Dark Souls, Final Fantasy 6, Persona 4, House of Leaves, Silent Hill 2, and the music of two DTs - Dream Theater and Dark Tranquillity.","“It's a game so personal and unique it's occasionally difficult to describe, but one that (maybe surprisingly, considering the description) also delivers everything an RPG should, and does it with style.” 4.5/5 – / “The tone of the game is refined and erudite, and if you have to look up what that means, you're probably going to be spending a whole lot of the game confused.

A lawyer can settle your scandals, but a preacher can energize the population. Raise funds from the wealthy, give gifts to political patrons, or hold rallies to build grass-roots support from the electorate. Along the way, expect to encounter scandals both real and fabricated as well as random events that test your moral mettle.

With each faction having their own unique styles of play, your decisions determine how successful you are in reaching your goals. Star Trek: Infinite has been meticulously created to provide an immersive Star Trek experience while allowing you to shape the story of your playthrough according to the choices you make as the leader of your chosen faction. As you take on the role of the Federation, you'll have the opportunity to recruit iconic captains and officers, including Picard, Janeway, Sisko, and Data to name a few. Meanwhile, other factions offer their own set of iconic characters to enlist, such as Gowron, Makbar, Garak, and many more. Beyond the potential cast of characters you recruit to your faction, the game grants you access to a range of starships from the Star Trek universe, tailored to each faction's arsenal. From the Federation's reliable Intrepid- and Defiant-class ships, the menacing Cardassian Galor-class vessels, the sleek Romulan D'deridex, or even the formidable Klingon Negh'Var battleships. Of course, the Enterprise-D can be developed and added to the Federation fleet through the bespoke storytelling system developed for Star Trek: Infinite.

Everyone starts on 45, but depending on whether you finish or not your races and drive cleanly this can rise and fall. Simple Rating is visible to all players in a lobby.

Prices and wares differ from one system to the other, so you have to do some exploration and find optimal trade routes.","“Spaceforce offers up a beautiful, dynamic universe to explore!” 4 stars – GAMESPOT",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/header.jpg?t=1447374880,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_4d25b99663ee2ccc91c4f0a88dda94dbe0852c22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_445d23bdcf807d2249c11a757b9b5fb09c331bd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_1175f1092e00a1abbad4362e661c281328565a89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_93add68fd8f7c0592fa6f99fd40e73f36262827c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_e765d1a7a3882ad46e35532857cb6b0b0d8b6048.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_be9f6efbcc542d5a001ec3baaae57250c99387b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_c78d329576c50916c6dfc931078da2f9044c931a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_36c76e1bd58750e2534d31c42166a879930ca2e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_622080c327ef23360dbb9ee9eaac852fe47b82d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_cced34f13e07169cb20e43c7cd2f703733a1d39c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_2579ca84e543aae73fa97c8b331249f73d9c8455.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_fe1baa6ba0da158785efd6e6c696323a2bcc02d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_767d0e55727a1e5215a2e97ee0b426715c07b862.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_af0eac10cbd5c124643427fbe455c633e2c2a4e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_b826a37ad5ab0f10856e3ae68b9588bb45a9306b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_cd0978537d5c986bb29695f4446a39c575a9cb92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_a9fd4a5e148f20d9f5e4ddf35142e555612b314b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_f1db7c1737b0a16788b59a3065737bbd11cc07b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_a2aae6e8bb78f8d48d6cfb82e8df044bb81c0c22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_a21a0fa3e9369e5b82724a507feca21a1d41710f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_1b9a5b345e2b53ab24c4e2ebb2c99bf984f035a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_db698f26dc48741d1f7b9e1e84483c9d464992fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_0dc78e396b49d2638f6ee9ec4a461a24f45e7f33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_e77ef9990b21015e085244f5f06b3f6f0b351334.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_7431e1ec7906f6d2d43b93bb3775c18a70faef18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_9318d2d138518b8fc965f4be090531d88e7f7870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_d098b0182b7dccdcbac5ae23ab2f1e7cf0fb0e76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372480/ss_391e6c7c5c08f1109fa29fe09428529aac808eea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374880","RPG,Simulation"

345,"Welcome to The Lonely Gorilla store page! This is a animal survival game in the tropical African rain forests and grasslands. A living, breathing environment. Advanced AI simulating animal behaviour. Full climate and weather system. What do you do in the game? Explore Rain-forests, grasslands and mountain ranges. Role play as a wild silver-back Gorilla separated from his troop. You must survive the harsh environment finding food, water and shelter. The ultimate goal is to be reunited with your troop, then protect them against predators and the environment. Can you regain their bonding after the separation? As the alpha male only you can keep the troop together and have the right to mate with the females to produce offspring. If bonding is not high this will not occur, and can even lead to challenges from rival males for troop leader status. As food resources dwindle, you must lead your troop to new areas while keeping them safe. How long can you survive? The game is an indie experience from a small team with a focus on the environment and wildlife. We want to give you a true feeling of this amazing, vastly unexplored area of our planet.

374,"ASCENXION is a 2D shoot 'em up game where you explore the field to progress. We've borrowed elements of Metroidvania style games, in which you unlock new areas with skills and items that you obtain through exploration. Players must overcome puzzles, traps, elite units, boss fights, and other various obstacles while navigating the field. Grow stronger through rewards earned, to uncover the truth of this world. 　 Synopsis One day, humanity became extinct due to an enormous explosion. Not a single entity was left to pass on the reason behind the extinction, nor to remember those who had disappeared. After what seemed an eternity, you have awoken in the midst of traces of a past human civilization. As you wander aimlessly, you encounter various records left behind by humans and beings who assist you. Will you be able to uncover the secret of this world and face the truth? 　 Features Fast-tempo battles with added strategical elements ASCENXION is an action shoot 'em up game, but in order to give the player a combat experience that differs from bullet hell games, we decided to make choices and concentration key gameplay points, instead of simply avoiding enemy bullets and attacking all over the place. There are a variety of strategic elements such as terrain cover, reduced movement speed during basic attacks, and mutual sharing of resources consumed by attack and evasion skills. Also, players must use basic attacks, skills, and items' active effects to defeat enemies. Get items through exploration Players can explore unknown lands to acquire dozens of distinctive items. Items are divided into 'rune stones', which combine weapons and use effects, and general items which provide basic lasting effects and experience bonuses. Elements of Development Important concepts in ASCENXION are 'unleashing potential' and 'skills'. Each aircraft type has four skills, and from the second skill, they will be unlocked upon defeating boss monsters that you encounter during the game. Skills You can only select one of two skills for each stage, but you can change your choice at any time. You need smarts and a good gamer mind to change your skills according to the situation, whether it be the terrain or enemy type! Unleashing Potential ASCENXION has a main character with some great power sealed inside. Of course, this great power can be unleashed. By completing an event that you will inevitably encounter during the game, you can unleash this power, and when this power is unleashed, modifications are made to its skills and overall stats that suit an aircraft of such great power. Each unleashed aircraft has a different play style, so choose the one you like, and keep leveling it up!","“게임 피지컬을 발휘해 적의 탄막 패턴을 피하고 일반 공격과 특수 스킬, 무기 스킬을 적절히 퍼부어 적들과 보스를 제압하는 슈팅 게임으로써의 재미는 확실히 일품이며, 메트로배니아 게임으로써의 완성도 또한 일정 수준 이상을 보여준다. 그만큼 어려운 난이도의 게임이기도 하지만, 슈팅 게임과 메트로배니아 게임을 모두 선호하는 게이머들이라면 상당히 만족스럽게 즐길 수 있는 게임이기도 하다.” Recommended – Kutar'k",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/header.jpg?t=1655723048,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_add4710a82f77b0ee508b489df1602764712e913.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_ec4306e44fc208ffb55c6790d855547e510c32fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_8b75a280f6be31035e4425202c1ac1e85494fe58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_ba3d5067b98559827d37d671c1ec98be17dc36b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_efcaddb998803d0d4fa36428581c81dafde50d24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_5ef94d97e5e999bc0305962523825f3e2d84f859.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_5f4a2bd47f20405c38edd5fb8bebf88d0ad1bc23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_f6012397c7a4de980b013ffe48eef3747904b7f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_e8396fe9274a82643c0d6d008f3c84ea55c4b48c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_095d9bcef7fc2b7d613df6cca6d31c10e28c1cc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_8bf91905f1966076f3514dea6fd83b91305b91a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_3caf9dcb75c38044e36c294f03702e7b1427028d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1000000/ss_a8089554acd5eae5fbb818dd8d4087501ed16359.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655723048","Action,Adventure,Indie"

413,"Mirenia is an 18 year old girl on a quest for redemption. After unleashing an evil power when she was a teenager, she is now on her way to Tirkin Fortress to perform an ancient spell that should help her vanquish the very evil she unleashed three years ago. Now, nearing the end of her quest, she arrives in the villages just outside the fortress, where monsters ravage, young women are being raped and men are being slaughtered. Armed with her trusted Shield Blade, Mirenia is so close of undoing the mistakes of her past. Will she succeed or ultimately only make matters worse? The Skylia Prophecy is a sidescrolling action-rpg platformer set in a medieval fantasy world, based on the great Arcade hits of the past. As Mirenia, you will journey throughout the lands and towns, explore ancient dungeons and battle hordes of the undead in this hard as hell adventure inspired by the 'kill the player' philosophy of the 'Souls' games. Along your way you will meet the people of these lands, who will ask you to help them, sell you powerful items and reveal secrets to aid you on your journey. Not a traditional metroidvania game, but with elements of the genre, the scaled back combat rewards patience - the game is not unfair, but you have to pay attention! By interacting with the townsfolk, you will ultimately recieve rewards that make the game easier in the long run - thus, you set the difficulty for the final strech yourself! Will you find redemption or ultimately end up among the dead? The Skylia Prophecy will challenge you on every turn with its hard but fair difficulty, powerful bosses and exploration-based riddles. -------------------------- Features Upgrade Mirenia with a level and magic system Over a dozen different locations Beautiful pixel-art Story-driven exploration Tough-as-nails difficulty Atmospheric Music Challenging and complex boss battles Please read the instruction manual if you require assistance.","“A fun little fantasy platformer, The Skylia Prophecy makes for a charming throwback to the early days of gaming” 7/10 – Pure Nintendo “The Skylia Prophecy is an action-platformer that manages to rise above the average through its quirks and charm.

You have to put an end to history books, planned obsolescence, kitschy dresses, never-ending sagas of boring video games and pea soup. And if there's someone in the world that hates vegetables more than Nika, it's her friend Agatha, the insomniac butcher and prophetess of Carnivorism that loves animals and their succulent meat in equal measure.

Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do?

You load into a zombie infested game area and are forced to search for weapons and defend yourself from evil zombie clowns, thugs, and cops!!!","“Very good game with some beautiful graphics. As the title suggests, the main enemy you will be fighting is zombies. But don't let that fool you, this game is much more than mindless zombie slaughter. The second you begin playing this game you embark on a dangerous journey to save the world from zombie infestation, and let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride. This game is an absolute masterpiece and I have been anxiously waiting its release ever since it was originally announced back in 2011. I can not wait to see what is to come for this game, and hopefully series, and look forward to seeing it among all the other AAA titles such as Halo, Red Dead Redemption, Call of Duty, etc. I can not stress enough how good this game is, and if you do not believe me check for yourself, this game will go down in history.” 10/10 – Kyle Guarnieri “Wow, just wow.

Since I am a multi trillionaire, I can guarantee that more than half of my earnings each day will go to this absoloute beast of a game. I don't know why anybody would think I would put my money to charity, a cure for cancer, or the people on the streets when I can put half to the game and half to the wall.

694,"Icebound is a steampunk fantasy visual novel and puzzle game in a world that has fallen into the depths of a thousand-year ice age. Alchemy is a very real ability to manipulate the forces of nature and machines run using clockworks and steam. Humans have united under a mighty continent-wide empire that seeks to harness the power of alchemy, while the horned race of ferans lives in tenuous peace. The wandering alchemist named Dougal wields the power of fire, which is often shunned as an evil omen, so he never stays in the same place too long. During his travels, he winds up in Isenbarr, an isolated frontier town. When he tries to find a job there, he stumbles upon a mysterious challenge with a potentially priceless reward, and several other alchemists vying for the prize. With a monster plaguing the town, he must use all the alchemical skills at his disposal to prove that fire can truly survive in this world of endless ice. But what is the monster, and why is it here? The truth may be more related to Dougal himself than he believes... Novel-length story A whimsical yet complex story with over 100,000 words of alchemy, mystery, romance and deceit.

Majestic Trials is a turn-based fantasy tactical game where you must compete in increasingly challenging trials to earn your place within the Majestic Citadel. To succeed you will need help.

754,"STORY In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form. Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is commonplace. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing everyday people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive. Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications. Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study. You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company. THE GAME The subject is a sci-fi puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements and visual aesthetics of early 80s sci-fi.

765,"Fancy Skulls is a challenging first person shooter with procedural generation, permanent death and distinct art style. Intense and tactical combat, unique weapon mods and items that change the way you play. Foes different not only in visual design but also in their behavior. For example there is an enemy that will teleport every time you hit it, or enemy that leaves bombs that home on you, but you can shoot those bombs to use them against it. Usable items and power ups, like friendly sentry, an eye that lets you transmute items, kite that lets you fly, matchbox that ignites all foes around you, and much more! Each weapon is different from another, and every weapon can be modded with options that provide interesting game experiences like 'walk backwards to get ammo', '12 hits with no misses give you money', 'last two bullets in a magazine do double damage', 'don't spend ammo while in the air', 'shoot lightning bolts with shotgun'.","“It’s a simple but subtle game, and each playthrough has delivered a new insight into its world and the odd things that operate within it.” Rock Paper Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/header.jpg?t=1589221406,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_38f7c5d6e45eeb390b7a518f7c7ec9fd5cbb1428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_3ec3e05de11d918692f1b758e5e23f72d56b132f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_2e24a91a24bf5095fe1efa775f3793b39b036842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_20ca28d364d7bf57ca42a649b4371ab3ddd3eaf3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_d7a692f4a4cddaea8fbb094140378276a0d72529.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_4893291f816a659e0da3d9b1a176d250b2fa0830.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_dde233d42544d91eb197fe2b8bff85ced6a064a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_f7af2c8ed9a1fc595fd1eda59bd5d9d9c86d56e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_c6e41b692d55bc2d0b9d1b9bc00bb467d126a9f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_054c5254d186006675fc6264db4512c926c4597e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/307090/ss_e1a46f1422bfd0b5f386ac50ef89fcef2348c7d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589221406","Action,Indie,Early Access"

774,"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach.

868,"Developer's Note Hi, I'm Alex Schearer the founder of Spotted Zebra Software. I've been making games for a while, but always in two dimensions. I wanted to learn how to make 3D games and decided that making a game a week was a good, challenging way to do so. Arrowpoint is my second week long game. You've got a bow, a horse, and a burning desire for glory. Luck would have it that there's a mysterious beast wandering the desert nearby, so what are you waiting for? Go forth and leave your mark on the world! Arrowpoint is a simple game about hitting a bunch of targets and waging battle with a huge beast. It's fun because firing arrows from horseback is fun and because waging war with giants is fun. I'm releasing Arrowpoint for one dollar so people can join me in this crazy game-a-week adventure. If you'd like to share your thoughts, please leave a review or post to the Steam forums. If I get enough feedback I will improve the game based on what player's want. Thanks for reading this; I really hope you enjoy the game! Alex Schearer - Spotted Zebra Software Gameplay Ride your horse and fire at increasingly more challenging targets.

903,"Fly low and strike deep in the re-invention of the Gunship flight combat franchise. In Gunship!, you're the point man for WWIII -- Russian forces have amassed on one side, NATO on the other in a flashpoint conflict in Eastern Europe. You are about to deploy the most devastating weapon in the inventory of war: the helicopter Gunship! Finesse, raw power, stealth and speed blend in a high-wire balancing act of exacting proportions. In the 21st century, the fate of war can turn on one micro-engagement in the epicenter of action. Features: Separate modes emphasizing realistic simulation or instant action to suit different play styles. Customize your crew and loadout in American, German, Russian, and British helicopters. Enter the fray in 20 unique missions","“Gunship! is pretty much everything we hoped it would be. There's enough action in this box to make it more than worth the buy for any sim enthusiast who's been looking for the right copter to fly. Even if simulations aren't the bread and butter of your gaming collection, you may still want to give this one a shot. It offers up a lot of action to the arcade gamer looking for something a little different. Chances are you may very well be playing this thing well into World War III.” 8/10 – IGN “While Gunship! has serious realism problems, it has absolutely gorgeous graphics. The terrain is particularly impressive, and it conveys a great sense of being airborne. In fact, the major reason that Gunship! should be considered a flight action game is that its strengths parallel those of a good first-person shooter: It looks pretty, and it's easy to blow things up. Therein lies the game's appeal: While hard-core pilots will groan at the oversimplified avionics, casual sim pilots will enjoy the 'point-and-shoot' simplicity of the game, as well as the ability to make just about everything on the map explode. Even trees seem to be filled with some kind of combustible material; they vanish with an explosion when hit by cannon fire.” 6.7/10 – Gamespot",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/header.jpg?t=1488329407,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/ss_14d00b71716e318fdfdeff442f6eb412ca279856.1920x1080.jpg?t=1488329407,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/ss_f5946977bb39f968160cb9a5bfe6938e59f38b94.1920x1080.jpg?t=1488329407,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/ss_baf4af82a2cbdb284d036d2c3537dcd3c2e9a63c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1488329407,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/ss_691f9fb4a9fc84bc06022f6efb3058abf9e40015.1920x1080.jpg?t=1488329407,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/286730/ss_fa8ffd9a88e54d0c4d2cd35876012c26d966220f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1488329407","Action,Simulation"

917,"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, 'El Hijo' must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave 'El Hijo' at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. 'El Hijo - A Wild West Tale' is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and 'El Hijo' will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that 'El Hijo' must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.

We will use the feedback from players to shape the direction of the next chapter. We hope that this unique approach will provide an engaging and thought-provoking experience for all participants, as everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the game. You can come up with your own character, your own riddle, put something of your own into the game! Immerse yourself in the mystical atmosphere of an eternal summer evening, with a nostalgic nod to the 80s and 90s Eastern Europe. Our inspiration comes from real objects found in our grandfathers' homes, which we have carefully recreated to transport you back in time. We will curate a selection of player-generated ideas to feature in the upcoming chapter. Moving forward, only paid subscribers will have the opportunity to contribute story influences and suggestions. However, for the first chapter, all those who have purchased it will be able to participate in this exciting creative endeavour by submitting their own photos or items or ideas for consideration. Our indie game was created by just three of us, and we took on the challenge of developing it in two languages. Our goal was to create puzzles that were out-of-the-box and a plot that was strong enough to keep players hooked. The plot is rich with details and hooks, and each player will have their own interpretation of the game. The protagonist of our story receives a letter from an old friend, inviting him to visit. Upon arrival at the familiar apartment, he realizes that everything has changed and time seems to have stopped there. As he explores the space, unable to find his friend, he begins to question whether he truly knows this place. With each new discovery, strange occurrences begin to unfold. This first-person game is set in Eastern Europe at the end of the last century, immersing players in its mysterious atmosphere and evoking nostalgic memories for some. This linear quest is filled with numerous mysteries that each player will interpret differently. After completing the first chapter, we invite every player to fill out a form describing their vision of the game and submitting options for further plots. Get ready for a journey into the unknown! The game supports Xbox gamepad . The game has an autosave system . In the pause menu we can see where you are now and some hints. We thank everyone who helped us. And also the guys who sold us the assets. We thank EpicGames, RBL labs and our parents of course!","“Quite promising first-person quest game.

1022,"You will have to live through a brief moment in the life of a nameless man, who found himself in the middle of a cold world and was stuck in a routine job. One day an event happened in the man's life that changed the whole further course of his life and his views on what he was doing all the time after waking up... Features: An unhurried story, invented by one man, with a finale that will leave you with food for thought. Once In Flowerlake is a non-violent game, with no need to shoot or kill anyone. The presence of moments where the player's choices affect what happens next. Nice visual style and atmosphere of the cold, winter world. Atmospheric soundtrack to keep the right mood. Important note: the game was created by one person, so it can not offer a long duration. On average, it takes an hour and a half to get through the game. It's important to me that you know this before you buy, so you won't be disappointed about it afterwards. Thank you for your understanding!","“Once in Flowerlake is a game to pass a few hours with. It may be on the short side as to playtime but the price point reflects this. I do think the game could have some dark tones added to it so the main character can be seen a little more clearly and adjust the text so it can be read without the player having to climb into the screen. There are a few twists and turns in the plot that keep you hooked to push on to see its conclusion.” I Like It – LadiesGamers “Once in Flowerlake is an atmospheric game for people with patience, and I genuinely mean that in the nicest possible way. It portrays individual components well, such as stagnant routine, temporary friendships, a foreign world, and what trudging through snow feels like, but all of these elements mixed together get in each other’s way at times. If you feel to your core that life is about the journey, not the destination, Once in Flowerlake is a tiny yet tantalizing tale worth playing through.” 3/5 – Hey Poor Player",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/header.jpg?t=1642282701,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4f917411b92bf7f7cd7eb5a8d9e493496fd1b290.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_47f5bb873000670355ced7e84e6f4f7f2a9b992b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_9a3bfa37192c5f4b40463722da5d7398ab7af92a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_4ad416e32e63c4fece0d6f58876e4f6711f5ec6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_92c10f6b3c25e774f03b9561f291e8ce17f2e069.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_8323875624f81f191cf5b74f39faa536f0d87196.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_05fbcfbc2c759ba752b1f4c0f63fb920845bd36d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1679740/ss_687223fffd4fc085987e5f17afdcb92050fc4aa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642282701","Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation"
1028,"KING MAN! Retro KING MAN! Super KING MAN! Three classics from the past are celebrating a glorious return, bringing you all new features, modern tweaks and the soul of the late 80s and early 90s in one funny package! KING MAN Released back in 1988, KING MAN quickly became a favorite among 8-bit gamers, due to its silly humor, catchy music and clever level design. Paving the way for future installments, this single screen puzzle platformer impressed with its high quality graphics and mind-twisting levels. Retro KING MAN Released in 1990, Retro KING MAN changed the gameplay quite a bit, as players could explore large maps to find upgrades for the KING MAN. Without knowing it at that time, this game featured many ideas that would become a staple of metroidvania and platformer gamedesign in the years to come. Super KING MAN Released in 1992, Super KING MAN brought the titular hero to a new generation of fans, with even sillier humor and over the top voice samples. The game was groundbreaking for its full-screen pixelation effects, the use of widescreen and iconic voice acting. Rounding out this spectacular package is a documentary about the full history of the series, how it started and how it all fell apart. Experience and enjoy these wonderful classics from an era that never was for the first time since their original release and dive into the world of the KING MAN - metaphorically, of course. ------------------------------- Controller Information: This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads. However, due to limitations with the engine, some controllers may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.","“Trilogy King Man is a fantastic set of games that serve as an example of how games were due to the limitations of hardware, and how that didn’t stop devs from making memorable games.” 7.4/10 – Gertlush Gaming",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/header.jpg?t=1643743192,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_15f163bb3291ee5fbe6418069f0a24a3730b5c40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_9316585cdf930dca482b5704d41deffdf56010aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_a17c65455c68a3a817909a5fc16edc41fc4fa5ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_a879847a6ea8aca3afc270f5a2d638bf2ea2afa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_644380d8f32d3ac20414d3888b8962eea57c5245.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1606140/ss_13a5d4fa467d8a21778d1b3ec722df8887e565a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643743192",Indie

1046,"Robot rebellions should be quelled by the best of the best. When the best of the best are killed... it's up to you. Subdue the uprising in time, or your corporate overlords nuke the city. Bionic Dues is a tactical, turn-based roguelite with mech customization. Guide multiple classes of Exos through a variety of missions filled with enemy robots that are as buggy as they are angry. This is at least as bad as it sounds. Explore for loot, destroy key robotic facilities, and brace yourself for the final attack by your enemies... just as soon as they can pull it together. Features Out-think wide-ranging tactical situations featuring robots with bad GPS, terrible aim, insecurity, a lack of focus, a tendency to backstab, and dozens of other maladies to exploit. Over 40 unique bots, ranging from the hilariously inept-but-dangerous DumBots, BlunderBots, and BatBots to the terrifyingly effective WyvernBots, DoomBots, and MurderBots. Carve your own path: choose 30 to 50 missions out of the 120 you discover as you explore the city map. Which missions you choose determines how prepared you will be for the final battle against the massing robot army. Missions come in 23 different general flavors, and are entirely procedurally-generated like a floor of a traditional roguelite. Mix and match your squad of four from six classes of Exos: Assault, Siege, Science, Sniper, Ninja and Brawler. Each has its own build and weaponry. Choose an overall pilot from a roster of six to add a powerful perk that lasts your entire campaign. Customize your four Exos with procedurally-generated loot that grants weaponry and defensive upgrades, new abilities, and more. Difficulty levels ranging from quite casual to incredibly hardcore. Save and reload your game with ease any time, or tough it out in ironman mode. Stellar soundtrack by composer Pablo Vega, headlined by the game's title theme 'The Home We Once Knew.'","“What's wonderful about Bionic Dues is that it manages to combine meta-strategy and micro-strategy... It's like a fast-paced, mini-XCOM.” Andrew Groen, The Penny Arcade Report “Top game moment: Realising a momentary oversight has condemned you to almost certain doom, but then, with only a perfect set of well-thought long-contemplated moves, you pull everything out the bag, blow the rig, and get the hell out of dodge to receive a hard-earned mission successful.” 8.5/10 – Richard Nolan, Strategy Informer “Bionic Dues delivers tough decisions, sweeping tactics and enormous mech battles; packing massive replayability and unpredictability into its budget price point. A 'Rogue-lite' to remember and to savour through numerous scorched-earth defeats and hard-won victories.” 8/10, Editor's Choice – Jonathan Lester, Dealspwn",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/header.jpg?t=1641757897,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_628445676dc8c3dbc767ebffe46dabb9d06e5748.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_d0538cf47c497be447ffd5231c2f46b60bb25d66.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_a41a74ca6cb56b8aa5fc32b223b96c80baa04129.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_d8ca0e412663c7a04c48156780dae025eb85fb23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_71e9446e7bf67c3cc6358290029dd414082a384f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_10c3506f392828c8b1b77be47cc923029bc92ec0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_ec99477644895ed8b5b9c78d7a21ad0691243441.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_9116494a7fff285165c4fdc98bd4a2779c00fd6e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_ba513e1aeb57a8611cae5d5bfc5317d066b46166.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_c41314c0bd45260da6584326629cce534b725791.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_89a3243d824d1fafb9cc36165bef1d54a8578545.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_26c334a55b2b1fadda74722ca68e16c1ed80e610.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_aa0caaf31b0cdade7af97499b3dd4c79d47184bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/238910/ss_d5be6bcfbbc610387ea2be567bd3b869c7c3aa7a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641757897","Indie,RPG,Strategy"
1048,"The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place is a short, interactive tale about a building eater consuming a tower on the edge of the town of Matsyapura. Using a blend of descriptive text and surrealist visuals it is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history. In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states. Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem titled : The Building Eaters of Matsyapur, he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the creation of a populace that is devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past. With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem. Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester. A site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix, Leicester. And at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.","“In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what can be done – if anything – to intervene.

There is a great sense of momentum and movement in Videoball. The sense of acceleration after a dead stop, the slipperiness of trying to reverse direction, the desperate race for a last-second save. Everything has a pleasing kind of grip to it.” 9 – Nic Rowen, Destructoid “With its distinctively clean retro stylings and deceptively simple set up, Videoball may blindside you with the pace and depth of its gameplay.

1201,"Sometime in the late 2000s, Howard James Wright - an old but kind man - perishes. Leaving behind him many adventures, relics he's collected over the years as well as books authored, he is also leaving Sarah, his granddaughter behind. Having to shoulder the arduous task of clearing out her grandfathers attic, she is soon to find that not everything about her grandfathers attic is what it seems. What Never Was is a short, story-driven first-person game focused on exploration and puzzle-solving. You play as Sarah Elizabeth Wright, exploring through your grandfathers attic, solving small puzzles and uncovering the story through gameplay. What Never Was aims to combine the gameplay of classic point-and-click games with the control schemes of modern adventure and walking sim games. It is inspired by the likes of Myst, Indiana Jones and The Longest Journey and borrows themes from folklore, Norse mythology, and works from authors like H.P. Lovecraft. The game is the first solo game and passion project of game developer Acke Hallgren with the support of a handful of supportive creatives.","“Games like WHAT NEVER WAS are the reason why i love exploring indie games, you can see some truly great games made with a little budget. Definitely give WHAT NEVER WAS a shot it is worth the time.” Gameplay Review “This adventure game is a reminder of how enjoyable the genre can be with a good story. Made by Acke Hallgren in the Unreal Engine, this brief point-and-click allows players to explore an attic that has some unexpected items. With puzzles that are just challenging enough, it is both relaxing and frustrating in a way that only adventure games can be.” 7.9 – Indie Hive “...a first-person adventure that feels like a cross between Gone Home and Myst. It’s smaller in scale compared to Gone Home — in What Never Was you only have access to a single attic, as opposed to a whole house — but the attic still feels like a real, lived-in place that’s full of information that’s waiting to be uncovered.” TheVerge",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/header.jpg?t=1608907034,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_8a37ada214cd08bf8606c8691f2bbe48f0cf66a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_8a12409865a1a5910f0c5f1fc308f99d901bc309.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_2ef19e7ca56703c01d88ca915beec9401afddaaf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_cd5d970b21289e683e52617edbe544a6a9f7c63a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_bffc09790b3da439359dfd5fd14e818094f94809.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/866440/ss_fc646f3b7b034600114227ee6948d8e6e28e8881.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608907034","Adventure,Casual,Free to Play,Indie"

1221,"Shadows over Silesia is a dark action adventure game with fantasy elements set in real medieval Europe. With true historical events in the background, you'll be facing intricate puzzles, challenging battles and cunning stealth. You will come across possessed devil worshipers, sexual demons, and beasts from hell, as well as creatures well-known from European mythology. Dark fantasy story Europe is in the middle of religious upheaval and many preachers predict that the end of the world is near. The year is 1428 and the Hussites have just set out on their Silesian campaign. These heretics appear to be the biggest threat in the kingless country. But true evil of a completely different kind is lurking nearby and it does not intend to engage in religious disputes. You will experience everything from the point of view of the two main characters. Hynek, a grumpy Hussite hetman who doesn't hesitate to swear or mess around with anything, and Lothar, a Hospitaller knight, a man of good education and manners who stands alongside his brethren in the front line of the Silesian defense. Each has their own motivations and views of the world around them, and different equipment and abilities. Their fates will soon become intertwined. Will they face one another, weapon in hand, or forge a fragile alliance to stand shoulder to shoulder against a far worse enemy? Challenging puzzles The original puzzles you will come across on your dangerous journey will most definitely be tough. Classic adventure games of the 1990s were a big inspiration. You will have to take advantage of your surroundings, look for objects, obtain information, and solve puzzles or encoded messages. Some problems can be solved in multiple ways, or they can be cleverly worked around. Sneaking in the shadows Sometimes you'll have to blend into the shadows and sneak past enemies to avoid being detected. Following their patrol routes and habits will help you find the best path. Tough combat The combat system is easy to understand but it takes practice to fully master it. Remember one thing: being outnumbered is a problem!

1259,"Devil's Dare is a 2D zombie beat'em up, supporting up to 4 players to co-op and fight together locally. Being the spritual successor to Bitejacker, Devil's Dare carries the same theme of parodies, pitting classic game heroes against monsters straight out of 90s horror movies. Devil's Dare doesn't just relies on grinding and leveling up, but instead introduces permadeath to keep players on their toes. With every kill, the player makes some cash, which you can use to purchase upgrades or save it to revive when you're dead. When you run out of cash completely, you are dead for good and it's time to start over again. This is a mechanic inspired by the good old arcade days, where every death meant another penny wasted! Our main influence were some of Capcom's classics like Alien vs. Predator, Battle Circuit, Final Fight as well as Sega's Streets of Rage Series. So if you were a fans of those, give it a shot. I'm sure you will find something to love in Devil's Dare. Play as one of the 4 unique characters, each with their own unique roles and abilities. Every one of them has their pros and cons, so learn to understand your character and fight with your strength! The game also has a dynamic difficulty. This means that the bigger your party, the bigger the mess. More enemies, tougher monsters and most important of all, you share your loot! Back in the good old arcade days, beat'em up were serious business! Every death is a penny wasted and every kill is a step closer to being the baddest ass in the neighbourhood with the highest score. Our permadeath mechanic is inspired by this very mechanic. Learn not just to kill, but kill with style. Perform a fatality to make more cash, which you can use to purchase upgrades or pay to revive when you are dead. And if you run out of cash to revive, you better hope you bought a soul token, because otherwise, it's game over. All the remaining cash is submitted as your score, and it's time to start all over. Make no mistake. You are going to die, and you're going to die a lot. But death in Devil's Dare is meant to be savored and embraced! Play again and again as different characters and pick a different path each time. There's a different boss guarding each level, and the awaiting boss gets stronger and stronger based on your selected sequence. Remember, you haven't finish the game until you beat them all!","“It channels the best memories of the past and puts them to work in its own ways.

1308,"In her mid-20's, Kelly has been forced to move back to Nebraska. Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home. Three Fourths Home is a visual short story in which you assume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother. Three Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation. Gameplay As a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home . Between the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home. New to the Extended Edition For its Steam release, Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an expanded edit of the initial release as well as several new elements, including a new epilogue in addition to a number of extra features. Epilogue: Idling in the Rubble Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, Idling in the Rubble follows another conversation that Kelly has with her mother.

1390,"In SPAZ 2 you must survive in an evolving post apocalyptic Galaxy. The zombie threat is defeated, infrastructure has collapsed, fuel is scarce, and scavenging means survival. Initially the Galaxy contains hundreds of fleets, each trying to survive. AI captains do everything the player can. The player is not special and is not the center of the Galaxy. As resource scarcity becomes critical, ships come into conflict just to survive. Factions may form for protection or split due to starvation. Old friends must become fodder. Stronger factions establish and defend territories, set up resource hubs, and establish star bases. Weaker factions may resort to banditry. Each captain is unique, persistent, and shapes the Galaxy. When factions meet, combat is usually the result. While the strategic side of SPAZ 2 is about exploration, territorial control, and faction building, the action side of SPAZ 2 is about ship construction, tactics, and salvage. Combat creates damaged ships and dead crew, but it also provides new salvaged parts. All the parts in SPAZ 2 are modular and randomly generated. If you see something you like, break it off an enemy, grab it with your tractor beam, and connect it to your ship. Ship construction can be done live during battles, though sometimes beating an enemy to death with their broken wing is also fun. Back on the star map, battles will attract other captains looking for salvage. Take your new parts and run. Upgrade, repair, and prepare to fight another day, for darker threats are about to emerge. Key Features: Two hundred persistent Captains that are able to do everything the player can, including forming dynamic factions, building structures, controlling territory, and going to War. A true living galaxy that is not player centric. It will develop differently each game through the interactions of the agents. Build your own faction from nothing. Randomly generated modular parts. Build the mothership that suits your play style, on the fly, in seconds. Every part has its own unique stats that contribute to the mothership. Every part has its own hull integrity and damage states. Every part is a real, working, ship component. Strategic ship building. The mass, location and shape of parts all matter. If a part blocks a turret, it will not fire. If a ship is too long, it will turn slowly. Too many engines will mean too little power for weapons. Every design choice counts. A fully physics based 3d environment where everything is destructible, takes damage from impacts, can be grabbed and even thrown at enemies with the tractor beam. Natural movement and controls. Movement is on a 2d plane and screen relative, much like an FPS. The combat feels like huge pirate ships battling on an ocean. Focus on tactical positioning and manage system power to unleash hell at the right moment. Epic ship to ship battles.

1392,"An Adventure Only Limited By Your Imagination. The most popular AI text-based adventure is coming to Steam! AI Dungeon is a text-based, AI-generated fantasy simulation with infinite possibilities. Unlike most games where you experience worlds created by game designers, with AI Dungeon, you can direct the AI to create worlds, characters, and scenarios for your character to interact with. You could lead an army fighting back an alien invasion, be a mythical detective investigating the attempted assassination of the fairy queen, or simply enjoy the pleasures of a simple slice-of-life scenario. Unlimited AI In this Steam release, AI Dungeon is offering its first-ever one-time purchase for an unlimited AI experience. On web and mobile versions, free play is action-limited, requires ads, and doesn't give access to premium model settings. In this exclusive Steam-only offering, you can play forever without worrying about energy limits. Unlimited access to Griffin, one of our language generation models Access to premium AI settings for Griffin No Ads Create Worlds Pick a character, a world, and a story. The AI will fill in the details for your unique adventure. Or choose predefined worlds from other users or a random one using our quick start! Take Actions You can decide what your character says or does. The AI will produce responses from other characters or world events for you to respond to. Every adventure is unique and unexpected. Make It Yours Save the scenario for later. Don't like the AI-generated text? Initiate a re-do or enter your own words. You are the main character AND director of the adventure.","“Unlike a classic text adventure like Zork — where players quickly become familiar with “you can’t do that”-style messages when they type something the designers hadn’t planned for — AI Dungeon can respond to any command.

1445,"The tide of Soviet power washing across the face of the Earth could possibly have been turned back at various stages of history. But the new energy sources they discovered lit a fire under the Russian war machine. So when Stalin rolled into Paris, the resulting flare-up of global conflict left little more than smoking ash heaps where America and Great Britain had been. Now, Stalin is dead. Though resistance movements have emerged, the Soviets still stand supreme as rulers of the globe. Only a force from beyond the earth could possibly tip the balance. Abram Krupin, leader of a resistance cell, knows this. When he sees a dog fall from the stars, then, he takes it as an omen. This dog speaks, wears silver armor, and has an arsenal of mysterious weapons. Abram calls her Laika. Laika believes that, despite all odds, she can protect the countless lives crushed by the Soviets. The Sun at Night is a 2D action platformer to be released in three parts. All episodes will feature: - Massive, nonlinear levels that model the layouts of real locations in a way not yet seen in other platformers - Large, choice-rich skill trees that let players approach the game the way they want to - A novel defensive mechanic that lets players turn the firepower of Laika's enemies against them - Smoothly flowing, fast-paced shooting action - A story of struggle and hope, full of twists and revelations - Rich, evocative art depicting a world dominated by a technologically ascendant Soviet empire - Secrets and rewards hidden in every corner for the determined player","“The Sun at Night is a video game and it wants you to know it...

1449,"More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum.

Create life-sized machines as tall as you can reach, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island. Your task is simple: get the squishy purple ball to that goal off in the distance, or above you, or on the other side of that gap. And your tools are elegantly minimalist: spinning wheels and stretchable rods. But the solutions are endless, and there are no right or wrong ones. We've designed this game from the ground up for room-scale VR. Come immerse yourself in a strange skybound archipelago and befriend Neko the photosynthesizing cat. Build contraptions with your own two hands, life sized and as big as horses, right there in front of you. Play with the physics, juggle pieces, throw darts, and feel another world all around you. Features: Challenging puzzles. 50 official levels that range from cakewalk to what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-right-tell-me-this-is-impossible. But guess what, it IS possible. I think. Infinite solutions. Working cars, tanks, catapults, conveyor belts, walking creatures or minimalist structures that use only gravity. Design for elegant simplicity, or build a rattling pile of junk that just barely makes it to the goal. Whatever. Building with your own hands. Movement so simple and natural you'll forget you're holding controllers. Need a wheel? Just pick it up. Want a longer rod? Just grab an end and stretch. It's like playing with children's blocks, except they're bigger than you are. Noble ancestry. Fantastic Contraption is the VR evolution of Colin Northway's 2008 2d browser game, played by millions and still playable for free . But don't be fooled, this new game is WAY different. Full 3d audio and music. Actually, this game has no music. What it does have is musical instruments. Except you have to build them. Well... you'll figure it out. Surreal and beautiful landscape. Hey guy, chill here awhile, why don't you just lie down in the grass and just listen to the sky whales singing? You'll totally forget the dystopian present and the 300 sqft windowless cube you now live in. Who needs sunlight? VR. Neko the toolbox. Yes, your toolbox is alive, and he's kind of a green cat blimp thing powered by pink farts. He doesn't seem to mind when you pull off one of his tails or yank a pin out of his head. They grow back pretty fast, so I guess it's okay... Online sharing. Venture bravely into the dark world-within-a-world to load contraptions made by your friends and also some random people.

1590,"Just Ski is a challenging, minimalist, physics driven game that will frustrate and punish you in the beginning but reward you with the feeling of mastery in the end. The Controls The controls for Just Ski are borrowed from an old, abandoned game called Ski Stunt Simulator. Your only control over the skier is to move your mouse down to make him crouch or up to make him extend. It's a very simple to understand mechanic but requires a healthy amount of practice to master. The key to success with Just Ski is learning to control your rotation while in the air. It's all about gaining a feel for the conservation of angular momentum: crouch to spin faster, extend to spin slower. Your Goal Just ski to the cabin.

1591,"SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy. The current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot. See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for an FAQ and links to more information. If you're wondering where the MacOS X port went, see that FAQ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags, but the non-Steam MacOS will continue to work, and I'll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully!","“There has never been a videogame like SpyParty. … SpyParty is as cerebral and personal experience as I’ve ever had with a multiplayer game. … Despite being two years away from completion, the early version I saw still remains one of the most subtle, enjoyable, and surprisingly playful multiplayer games I’ve yet played.” Destructoid “Part of what is so exciting about Spy Party is the stuff that happens around the game. Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it… guilt of all things. I’ve killed thousands — millions? — of enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker’s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized I was wrong. I felt bad.” Kotaku “SpyParty is like nothing else I’ve ever played. … When the laser focuses on you, the tension is intense. And the relief, when the beam swings away, is powerful.” Wired",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/header.jpg?t=1643776503,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_ea71ebb86fc525ced3eed8ebe7fb9ae60d5324a3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_adfb8520fa82c671ae07b76edff123d9f5a1bdfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_858aa57c0c5c6dfed6dcdfe27988991cc67c5234.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_be4659f5917efe5d0dd661385bc20cfa236ded78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_36b0a60b6d373fcf2269f852205b3153f42f7e10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_499f2985f587bc64eb179abef9a16932ffeadb93.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_0dc45885c43ca916c35f51c86519f279527ebde1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_1c553555d630a2c7d8306500739435ee2df06a5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_1c8063702acfc4daac935bca78f002fd6fcef862.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_9561468315fa0a8a590cbdb9c5acaf7ff40aca78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_790a60da9ed063e2efe51439429205bc0d00c5b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/329070/ss_e02504bc81ff87d24516898ffedf9a67556464b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643776503","Action,Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access"

1602,"Ekstase Ekstase is a love letter to Berlin and its techno scene. Amazing techno beats and beautiful visuals set the stage for a game that honors the long forgotten falling block puzzle genre. Fresh but familiar gameplay ensures that Ekstase is easy to pick up and sink many hours into. With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player. Gameplay description In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color. Game modes Reach a 'state-of-flow' in Flow mode Flow mode is the frictionless 'jump in' game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier. In doing so, the game teases out a 'state-of-flow' in the player, a state in which you are fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment. Keep a beat with Beat99 Beat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat. You'll be given 99 'lives', dropping a shape subtracts one life, missing a beat subtracts ten! Try to survive as long as possible and try to score as high as you possibly can. Pick your own challenge in Classic mode In Classic mode you set the challenge. Choose the amount of colors and the speed of the shapes. Time Attack Can you stack efficiently? Prove it in Time Attack mode. Beat the highscore in a set amount of time. Two rotation modes Ekstase can be enjoyed in two different play styles; play style 'A' and play style 'B'. In A you rotate the colors in a stationary shape, in B you rotate the shapes. This way you get two games for the price of one! Accessibility Are you colorblind? No worries, I've got you covered! In the options menu, pick your type of color blindness for the appropriate color palette, or hand pick the colors yourself. Motor challenges? No biggie! Ekstase comes with custom button mapping and co-pilot. Do you find the background animations too distracting?! Not a problem! Turn it down, or all the way off, from the options menu. In Raskal's games everyone gets to play.","“Ekstase is a well made, intriguing indie block puzzler. Whilst borrowing from [Lumines, Chime, Puyo Puyo, Tetris and Grave of the NecroDancer] means it feels familiar, it does also carry its own weight too.” Higher Plain Games “It’s absolutely brilliant. The only way I can describe it; it takes elements from Tetris &amp; Lumines without sticking to the rules of Tetris &amp; Lumines. It takes the music beats from both Lumines, Rez, Tetris Effect Connected and puts it in a blender, mixes it up with all the love and care of Nigella Lawson and produces an amazing action puzzle game that if you’ve played any action puzzle game, you get straight into this and get it.” Mental Health Gaming “If you weren’t feeling energised beforehand, once the music starts you should start feeling much more awake and with it… the thumping beat urging you to make the most of your blocks.” 8.2 – Impulse Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/header.jpg?t=1644138731,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_4b980933527070771e8a9643b038d08a97eeb8e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_108a6b3069fd622d97d82856d8fc6eb008d675c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_ff42e45a8f8dc4ac9e276c608ee844d4a38863d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_a0825875bd8f5699ca4a7cfc77db476713632209.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_c070392dd66b89bc86ad19eb0dddc5c617da9eff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_0f9a05529bc06ff8140a6aed96c28a1df32097c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1408430/ss_32fe7afa899bdcbd8843d50b93dcbfe0264a54e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644138731","Casual,Indie"

FEATURES: 19 challenging levels Zombies, attacking Plants and Monster Bosses A special bonus for those who can pass each level without dying Enemies and obstacles that will require both brains and skill to overcome Adele is not meant to be a zombie killing game. Players have to strategically maneuver objects to block their path, run away or trap zombies into falling in order to escape them. The game is set in different environments which impact your interaction with the zombies, being in a factory is going to be different than in the countryside, or underground.","“This does make for an incredible amount of challenge, as my play through of the game’s 2 level public demo took up to an hour &amp; a half of figuring out my next move in avoidance of zombies &amp; other obstacles obstructing my progress, failing to do so and then failing to carry out those moves when I did figure them out for the utter onslaught of environmental complexity in certain portions of the game. It was tough, but I enjoyed it.” Higher Eclectic Ground “Question: On a lighter note, which member of your team do you think would have the best odds of surviving a real zombie apocalypse? Why? Answer: None of us! We are just a bunch of geeks with zero survival skills. Getting us off our computer screens would be scary enough to give any of us a heart attack.” Greenlight Games “After playing Adele for a while, you might have a strange sensation of a Tim Burton universe, mainly because of the skinny animated characters and the dark colors of the game. However, the surrounding world and plot are far from that. The odd, macabre background almost wants you to pause for a while to look into the never-ending horizon. Hat’s off to the artists for achieving that. The music and sound effects provide a dramatic atmosphere which blends itself well with the gaming experience.” -review-adele-following-the-signs/",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/header.jpg?t=1464896298,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_eade7e6af98f09f5f161a0f54aa910b69edfdee7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_15b08d8937bc94a5a2790f587f858b4a858fea89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_d6067cf40aa32b6e0ce39fa90a23bcbaf04bbeba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_272ed87392cdfba9ca72d07f8139fb6766c171bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_ce365740fb6e1c76d93fa94d86316961a35d6670.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_6965b83cf71f8e4cd506edd8c9b697975007c57e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_ce20461a3da494c90a8de6259aa4b5fa17ee7ad6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_a3a981eb1456c15538d6f5e486d2284721c9d517.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_6e71cdcdd6284c1ccd5574cfd85c9520188ce0c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_7f9a124be044ba48742620c46b4f84ae4600e788.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_a3314a106e4e3056d8116e4a4fa871321ffd8385.1920x1080.jpg?t=1464896298","Adventure,Indie"

1662,"Please Knock on My Door is a story-driven game which gives you control over a person suffering from depression and social anxiety. Help them get through work and reach out to friends while desperately trying to survive. Experience the frailty these themes bring and gain a better understanding of what it's like to live with some of the most common mental health issues today. A compelling and emotional story offering a voice to those who have none. A fully voiced narrator who always has your best in mind. Probably. A gameplay system which adds to the weight of every story-choice you make. No 'Game Over' screen, only alternate endings that tie into your choices. A soundtrack that has been tailor-made for this experience. Relationships that can be developed or broken. Game length varies depending on your choices, ranging from 1-3 hours with enough content that you can come back and explore different parts of the narrative in consequent playthroughs. As in real life, all of your choices are immediately saved. There is only one save. Please Knock on My Door has been in development since autumn 2014 and was initially supposed to be a 6 month exploration of my own experiences with depression. A word of caution; this is a game that might be difficult to play for those who have dealt with psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. That said, I truly believe that through entertainment we are able to understand topics that would otherwise be too foreign for us.

And for each level you get to choose a new artifact for your equipment. You get rid of a pigeon, you're happy and you get stronger. Double win. And on top of that, each game is unique! Everyone has the right to choose how their life begins. The divinities are full of resources. It's up to you to choose your starting deity with its associated artifacts. But that's not all, you can get stronger and stronger permanently between games! Are you, like, famous ? I think some pigeons know you and want to shit on your house. If you're on Twitch, the pigeons look strangely like your active viewers in the chat... Between us, you always wanted to 'pacify' them, right? You are not safe anywhere Or are the pigeons not safe anywhere? Several locations are available with different challenges each time. Kill them, but kill them with style. I don't have more to say. It's up to you to choose your style, you'll be the last thing these evil pigeons will remember.","“Shit On My Roof is...it's a game!?! It's actually....NOT bad.

1859,"An afternoon spent walking between the gravestones reading the whispers of those that have passed. This is the experience Boon Hill promises to give. A graveyard simulator, with all the adventure of exploring a real graveyard without looking like a creeper. To put it as simply as possible, Boon Hill is a game about reading gravestones. There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again. Free Roaming The game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines. No Danger The game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you. Though they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard. Discover Mystery In the Graveyard Boon Hill is not aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations. The threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone. The specifics of what you can expect from Boon Hill: Fancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago. The ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive. Well over a thousand individual graves and epitaphs! It's the whole point of the game, after all. Several NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Crows! The graveyard has a lot of crows. It's as much a feature as anything else. Figure out what's up with that weird goth chick!

1861,"A true role-playing adventure. A campaign within the world of Vol, a fully realized setting inspired by the late bronze age in a Transylvanian landscape, with unique politics, races and gods steeped in history. Featuring a chosen party of five, you role-play Necholai, a minor god of a celestial body who descends to the Staglands for a moonlit festival only to find the way home blocked and immortality slipping away. Seeking answers and aid, you take on a mortal body and the guise of a traveling Spicer. This isn't a story of good and evil, saving the world or being a hero, it's about intrigue and your adventure of survival in a harsh land. While the game rolls the dice for you, you'll traverse the Staglands on a path narrated by your own wits and choices. A tabletop inspired experience with adventure-game like navigation, Serpent in the Staglands offers no auto-populating map markers, checklist quest grinding and rigid story exposition. Examine hand-drawn maps in your inventory for secret locations, diagrams of foreign languages, note encounters of interest in your in-game journal and figure out on your own how best to smuggle Spices. Roleplay, investigate, and pray to the RNG god when combat begins. Serpent in the Staglands features: Party-based, real time with pause combat focused on macro tactical decisions and creative party skill combinations Classless role-playing system: create builds via any combination of the over 100 magic, combat and aptitude skills available to create or find up to 5 unique characters Non-linear storyline to explore as your adventure allows No level scaling or story-blocked map barriers impede your adventure Dynamic item use, including an incantation book, hand-drawn maps, and a herbology kit for brewing potions Combat designed for minimal pause spamming and without cooldowns, instead focusing on pre-buffing, positioning and auto-triggering skills An unmarked map filled with wilderness, cities, towers, temples, dungeons and caverns to explore. Write your own journal notes for quests, puzzles and leads as you investigate. The game won't hold your hand or tell you what to do. Huge variety of enemies and challenges, including monsters, rogue mages and mutilated outlaws, which all can have the same spells and skills you do You'll never pay for updates, patches, or DLC of any kind for Serpent in the Staglands.

1963,"My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story of the cursed doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits of the little girl and the Devil. Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted. However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now. Key Features: Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal. Demons are lurking in the shadows. Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions.
