The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons. One of the leaders of this team is Hayato, an agile ninja, who clears the way through his enemies silently, with his sword and shuriken. Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat more fiends at one time, but thus also forfeiting flexibility. Aiko is a master of camouflage when she distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha. And the street child Yuki places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate. The mysterious marksman Takuma however, relies on his sniper rifle and takes care of the enemies from a distance. The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions. Play as five completely different characters with their unique skill set Conquer seemingly impossible challenges where you are outnumbered ten to one Find dozens of ways to take out your opponents the way you want Jump from roof to roof and climb large buildings to attack the enemy from above Explore beautiful environments of ancient Japan in the Edo era Choose from three difficulty levels to match your skill
Anuchard. It was known as a place of wonder and peace, a land of limitless bounty suspended in the heavens above. Five ancient Guardians kept it safe from all harm... Until they turned on the kingdom and its denizens. The Anuchardian paradise fell from the skies, crashing onto the surface of the world below. Only a tiny speck of an island survived the fall intact. The rest coalesced into a twisted mass of winding passages, wild magic, and vicious monsters, known simply as The Dungeon. Somewhere within, the five treasonous Guardians lay asleep. Generations passed as the few survivors eked out an existence in the Orchard, the sole village on the island, maintaining what little remains of Anuchardian magic. Farmers tend to the fields, scavengers try to pick the bones of the kingdom in the Dungeon. All await the Chosen One, the Bellwielder who will take up the Audros Bell, enter the Dungeon, and wake the Guardians from their slumber, and bring back the paradise lost: Return Anuchard to the heavens. Finally, you were judged worthy to take up the mantle of the Bellwielder. The Dungeon awaits! For everyone and everything. You are the Bellwielder and the Audros Bell is your best friend.

Use its knock-back ability to smash enemies into obstacles, reposition them, and clear the way forward. Use the Bell to solve puzzles in the Dungeon. Launch projectiles, move puzzle pieces, and employ it creatively to progress! The warped, magical Dungeon houses the Guardians you need to confront in order to restore the lost kingdom of Anuchard. Brave the dangers of the Dungeon, using the Bell to knock around and defeat the enemies that infest it! Face complex puzzles and solve them, to unlock the deepest reaches of the Dungeon. Finally, confront each of the five Guardians to learn the truth of the Anuchard's fall and return the kingdom to its rightful place in the skies! As the Bellwielder, you're destined to restore Anuchard to the skies - but that doesn't mean you can't help Orchard on the way. Explore the Dungeon to rescue the souls of lost villagers, returning them to Orchard through the ritual of revival! Each revived villager will contribute to your quest. Farmers, chefs, herbalists, all will help you and the village. Prepare for ever deeper ventures into the Dungeon. Cook up meals using ingredients provided by the Orchard, then head into the fray!

Save and reload your game with ease any time, or tough it out in ironman mode. Composer Pablo Vega's best soundtrack to date, featuring 54 minutes of music and the vocal finale 'Lay Down Your Arms.' More Details Greetings, Hydral. I will be your computer for this 'grand strategy campaign with turn-based tactical combat.' I think that's code for 'we're going to die.' Our solar system is vast and complicated, and I sense you are a little dimwitted -- so I tell you what, let's start with the simple stuff. Like escaping with this flagship you just hijacked from a bunch of angry robots. That seems important. Please excuse my impertinence, but I believe you are the last of a murdered race, yes? My records note you Hydrals were the dictators of the solar system, so basically you had it coming. And by 'it,' I mean the moon that smacked into your homeworld. Hmm. So people really aren't going to like you until they get to know you. Well, only you can use the scattered remnants of advanced Hydral technology, so that's something. Look, I'm not going to tell you what to do. My understanding is that you're trying to form the solar system's first-and-last unified federation, and that's noble enough. But right now nobody wants that except you, and you've got 8 very diverse, very angry races to either unify or exterminate. So... good luck with that. I'll help how I can.

'You are outgunned. You are massively outnumbered. You must win.' These are your orders. Humanity has already fought its war against the machines -- and lost. AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole, the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles, and the AIs have turned their attention outward, away from the galaxy, to alien threats or opportunities unknown. This inattention is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it's too late. You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs, but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores. Go forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down.

In Depraved you are the leader of the pioneers in the Wild West. You are about to start your adventure in a procedurally generated world with only one carriage full of resources. Select a suitable place for your first settlement and procure building materials from mother nature or by trading to create a new home country for your residents. The happier your residents are, the faster your town will grow. Supply your residents with food and water, so that they won't starve or die of thirst. Protect them against the weather and against illnesses by supplying them with clothes and fire wood. You will have to face numerous dangers. Storms, illnesses and bandits will strike at you, and also your own residents can become a danger, if you do not meet their needs. Are you ready for this challenge? Needs The residents of Drepraved have needs. Their basic needs are hunger and thirst which you can satisfy with food and water. In addition, every population type needs another food source. If your population type experiences a shortage of food and the preferential food is not available, you can nourish them with an alternative food source - however, this will affect the mood of your residents in a negative way. Unhappy residents commit raids and other criminal offenses or simply leave the town. The happier the residents of your town are, the more popular life in your town will become and more and more colonist will join you. If your town experiences famines, illnesses or lawlessness, the residents of the town will turn their backs and the streets will resemble a ghost town. Dangers The Wild West is dangerous! Dozens of challenges must be faced. There are different areas in which your residents can settle down - however, each of them is known for its own challenges. While in the desert the food and water supply remains a difficulty, in the snowy areas you can only resist by a constant supply with fire wood. Another danger comes from the surrounding animals. Even if most animals avoid humans, you should be cautious with wolves or bears. They can cause heavy injuries to your residents or kill them. Also surrounding camps and bandits can become dangerous. Do not underestimate them, because they rob your residents and commit raids. Such attacks affect the safety feeling of your residents and cost you valuable resources. Native Americans It's up to you: Native Americans can either be your friends or they can become your worst enemies. If you build a settlement in their neighborhood, they naturally feel threatened at first. To temper them and to gain their favor, you should trade with them. If you aren't interested in a peaceful coexistence, try to fight them and conquer their land!

Now with Chapter 1 and 2! Prepare for a story-driven campaign within the Sentinel Comics universe as you join forces with an ever-growing team of heroes to face a wide variety of villains. What seems like a typical bank heist reveals itself to be just the beginning of a much more sinister plan! Create your hero, gather your team, and save the world in this exciting new turn-based strategy! Build your Team - select from the many available heroes and unlock more throughout Full story campaign - writers and creators from Sentinel Comics Freeform movement - Turn Based game that allows you to move anywhere Squad dynamics - heroes or villains can work together for more powerful actions Living Environments - multiple objectives, interactions and dangers Create your Hero - choose backstory, archetype, powers, and appearance What kind of hero will you be? Custom Heroes Choose the character's backstory, personality, power source, abilities and costume. Heroes have 'stances' that provide boosts to certain stats like extra movement along with powerful sets of abilities and can be fully customized to fit your play style. Build your hero from 12 exciting themes - fill your stances with powerful abilities from any three: Power Melee - When you really want to hit someone really hard. Combos - Concentrate your attacks, spread 'em out, or bring a friend! Supportive - Whether protecting or attacking, the right move requires no planning. Blaster - Attack as many as you can in several different areas! Interceptor - Never let an enemy out of your sights and punish wrong moves. Minions - Disposable and endless, have your own minions fight for you! Gadgets - Deploy an arsenal of gadgets that eliminate all who oppose you. And more! Creating a superhero identity is more than a costume selection! Choose how your hero uses their abilities, different weapons, attack styles, and special effects; some themes even have different types of units that you can summon. Refine your heroic identity throughout the game - changing everything about how your hero looks, all the way down to your hero's body type, between any mission. Sync and Vigilance Actions Sync and Vigilance actions add life to the battlefield when characters perform additional actions out of sequence, triggered by special conditions. When a character performs an action, sync actions allow other characters to take part or enhance that action, like a character creating a distraction to remove the target's Evade defense before an attack lands. Positioning your team to take advantage of these extra actions can be critical to the success of a mission. Vigilance allows an inactive character to react to the active character based on various triggers, such as moving through their line of sight. Each character has a 'vigilance zone' around them which sets the chance of the vigilance action happening. These actions can go much further than the standard overwatch with actions like 'keep cover' which allows a character to try and find new cover when flanked. Large Scale Missions Players will embark on several missions throughout the campaign. These missions are broken up into groups of engagements - each offering unique objectives, enemy types and player choice on where to go next - keeping each feeling fresh and unique. Another benefit to these smaller engagements is that the player will not be overwhelmed by both the quantity of enemies and time for each turn. However, stringing all these engagements together still allows the player to feel like their heroes are very powerful as they dispatch lots of enemies throughout the mission. Initiative Will you be able to rescue the hostages in time? Can you survive the chaos until more defensive actions are taken? Initiative can have a major impact in situations like these. In Sentinels of Freedom, initiative determines the turn order for all characters and events in a round. Actions from previous rounds can have a major impact on initiative. A Swap mechanic allows hero to shift their position in the initiative order allowing more control over which hero to activate. The first hero in the initiative order receives a speed bonus while the last hero is awarded an accuracy bonus.

It looks like Roland, the King of the Bugs, has just stolen one of the Keeper of the Warmth from the Mushrooms. Be a hero, do hero stuff and get that artifact back! How does it sound? Gameplay Each area of the game is an endless turn-based battle in which you'll have to defeat dozens of enemies instead of the standard handful, and try to go as far as possible. In Wacky Spores: The Chase you don't just select your targets like other turn-based games, you manually aim weapons and abilities so that you can maximize the enemies hit and the damage done.

In every battle you collect coins by picking them up or by completing quests. The more coins you get the faster you level up unlocking more characters, weapons, artifacts etc, which in turn will push you further in every battle. What you get Easy to pick up but deep gameplay: just pick a weapon and start running. Tactical depth and manual aiming: move enemies around the battlefield to arrange them for the perfect shot, disable some of them or just obliterate them! Unlock a buckton of stuff : over 20 different enemies and bosses, 10 different characters, 12 weapons, 12 artifacts and 10 items that drastically change the way you play. Complete quests and pick up coins: how else would you unlock those goodies? Move your party in real time: position them for the next turn and dodge bullets.

You take command of the US Marines and will test your ability to do better than those brave Marines did back in 1945. Realistic battle depiction Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases. In each phase you get to move, support, or attack following a strategy that has to combine enemy lines penetration, HQ communication lines, and overall support for the units that are in heavy contact with the enemy. Units are approximately company-sized. A challenging strategic problem Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle.

Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability. Make the most of your resources Use the support points on units that are likely to be fired upon by the Japanese, especially when moving, to reduce your losses. Keep your units fatigue levels low by resting them from combat as they will become less effective as they keep on fighting.

Stephanie 'Watts' Watson, an aspiring bassist, bounced from audition to audition never finding music that really resonated with her, that is, until she discovered the magic of funk. Caught up in the groove, she recruits a group of hometown amateurs to take on art school darlings La Tormenta at the Battle of the Bands. Time-based sokoban-style puzzles Character-driven story set in 1990s suburban America Strategy-esque squad resources and rewindable turns to optimize your solutions Sequenced combo moves and 40 levels of strategic madness Join Watts as she grows on a musical journey rooted in funk and fusion. Soulful grooves and hot licks are composed by Pete Fraser, session saxophonist to the The Pogues, Friendly Fires, and Field Music! Twenty musical motifs are recorded by a live ensemble of seven funk masters, providing the foundation for the dynamic music in the game. Unique songs are generated depending on what directions and paths you take in each puzzle. Customize your performance with alternate playing styles, instruments swaps, and realtime audio effect pedals. Each character in your band moves through the sokoban puzzle maps in different ways, encountering unique solutions and obstacles. Advancing a character consumes a turn and part of the timeline, setting up interactions with other characters and enemies at different points in time. Rewinding a turn undoes your move, allowing you to find improved solutions and new ways to tackle problems. Manipulate each character separately, rewinding or fast-forwarding along the timeline in the process to reach her current point in time. Changes in time are reflected in the progress and actions both past and present of each character, creating some possibilities and removing others. Each character has his own resource-limited super move which can be triggered under certain conditions. Tip toe through tight spaces with your bassist, slide through guards with your keytar player, break through walls with your drummer, or blow enemies out of the way with your mighty super sax. Strategic use of your super moves increase the number of solutions to each puzzle and are the key in gaining a maximum score. Four resource-based musical metrics govern how and when you can move and interact with objects in the levels. These can completely block progress if used inefficiently, and create amazing musical chains and high scores when regulated artfully. Backbeat is a homage to the 16 and 32-bit story-driven games of the 1990s, recreating the challenges and victories of the last days of analog life and the birth of the internet. The suburban Washington D.C. area is reflected in diner parking lots, shopping malls, and dimly lit arcades. A colorful cast of supporting characters both friend and foe join Watts as she struggles with leadership, success, and holding together a band.

Explore the reaches of the archipelago by boat. Take to the skies as a bird to survey the landscape and plan the best route forward. For a generation, the terrible Fog - one vast, voiceless, and cruel spirit - has been eating the once-thick forests of the mainland. Now, with nowhere left to call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin towns of the rocky coast, discover the truth of the Fog, and, if possible, put an end to it.

In the Pause Between the Ringing is a short story from the world of Somewhere . The story of an inventor called Iqbal and of the first telephone mines in India. In a country stitched with telephone wires, it is not surprising to discover that a history of the telephone was first written in a book of Geology. The telephone is after all a noticeable fixture of the Indian landscape. And it's sonorous ringing has long heralded sudden and momentous changes in the minute destinies of its people. The instrument can be found, amplifying the terrifying horns of Babur's army from the ragged edge of Chenab . Or clattering with the shouts of Chalukya craftsmen, that once echoed along the Badami temples. It is even heard across time, like the chiseling of Ashoka's inscriptions that would manifest as an unresolved ringing in the inner ear of James Prinsep. Or when William Brooke O'Shaughnessy believed that, much like cholera riddled veins, these telegraph cables would let him pump restoratives straight into the heart of a troubled nation. In this country of telephones and wires, phone directories become genealogies, telephone exchanges become places of pilgrimage and the ringing, clicking drone of its machinery - a metronome of the sporadic history of this land. Our story is told amidst this tangle of cables and time. It is told when Iqubal awaits a telephone call and his perpetual pause forces a recollection of the terrifying history of the telephone in India.

Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not. One user described it as 'A million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain.' Another said 'I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked me out a little.' A particularly enthusiastic user stated 'Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe.' A Fine Art Game Anomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or objectives. It is a 'game' in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore. Generate and Explore You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and sounds they generate. Sights and Sounds Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and 'songs' you hear in the demo video were produced through the program's algorithms. Other Options Using a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show. Experimental I call Anomalies 'experimental' because of the way in which I developed it. I started with a simple idea - 'what would trees look like if they grew in space?' - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - 'what if they move or wiggle? What it they make sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?' - and so on, until I arrived at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...

POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled.

This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for. 1587, 2A - 15 years have passed since the guns of the Great War at last fell silent. The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart.

Are ghosts real? You are on your first solo ghost hunting case, under the watchful instructions of Bear and Jen from the O.P.G paranormal team. Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views.

Ruin everything. You are a banker. You want to extract as much wealth from the world as possible--or, at least, more than everyone else. You will manipulate the global economy in order to siphon money into your secret Swiss bank account. Whoever has the most Swiss money in 12 turns wins the game. Play solo against the AI or multiplayer against people who will imminently cease to be your friends. Buy votes. Unlike most strategy games, you will never have access to armies and never directly control territory. Instead, you will spread your influence throughout the globe by purchasing votes in parliament, or selling your votes to incite a military coup. You always share power with your rivals, waiting for the moment when you can backstab them. Make free trade agreements. Re-route industrial wealth throughout the world, from Mines to Factories via exploitative trade agreements. Remember: your goal is to make a profit, NOT to improve the world. Manipulate the IMF. Control the International Monetary Fund to force policy decisions without a regional parliament's approval. Basically, screw over your opponents without them being able to do a thing about it. The map is upside-down Because why not.

You also develop the dragon's combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself. That is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight.

Shoot, propel, and pogo your way through dozens of challenging levels to fulfill Blot's destiny! Loads of levels! Strange, yet oddly charming, boss fights! A unique, physics-based way of movement. Quirky humor and jokes. Is this a plus? I honestly don't know. It's a hard game. Both a pro and a con! STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS TO PROVE YOUR TERRIBLE TENDENCY TO BE A COMPLETIONIST! Gatlin' is a physics-based platforming bullet hell where you are the bullet hell! Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying. You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right. I hear you asking, 'What causes me to die?' That is an oddly-morbid question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die to tears. By the way, that last thing is both figurative and literal . The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to. Each boss also reveals c r i s p y lore and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I guess. The endgame of Gatlin' is a distinctive twist on the existing gameplay. After the conclusion of the main story, level modifiers are unlocked. Want levels to be more difficult? We've got you covered. Imagine Hell itself. Good work. Now imagine Hell without gravity and now every surface is covered in soap. Get the picture? Does Hell not sound appealing enough for you? Understandable, everyone's a critic. Instead, we offer a wide array of eccentric and ever-expanding levels, worlds, and challenges to partake in. Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind. If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said, we highly encourage speedrunning .

Turn a scripted steel-cage wrestling match into a real fight in this 250,000-word interactive novel! You've always dreamed of becoming pro wrestling's biggest star...but a wrestler's world is fraught with hardship and betrayal, in and out of the ring. Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success. But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly. This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever. Slammed! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. There's never been a professional wrestling game like this, a game where the outcome of your final match, your choice of opponent, and your relationships affect the ending. When's the last time you played a pro-wrestling RPG with a 'kayfabe' stat?--or where your trash-talking 'promo' ability is as important as your core strength and wrestling technique? Enjoy a 250,000-word personal tale of friendship, competition, and revenge. Develop not only your physical abilities, but a favored wrestling style. Become a heroic face, or a villainous heel--or even turn heel. Turn a scripted match into a real fight--and vice versa. Decide when to keep kayfabe, and when to break it. Play as male or female, gay or straight.

We only develop games that embrace that era, aiming to provide true classicly styled gaming, with a massive retro feel, maybe with a slight hint of what these games would have been with a little more processing power. We don't aim to develop AAA games, but simply to bring our passion for a time gone by to those who love truly classic themed and inspired games. If this is a genre and era that you love, then our games are for you. Solar Wind is our take on the classic sidescrolling shoot 'em ups of the past. Fight your way through deep space, penetrate asteriod belts, swoop low across alien moons, and weave through narrow caverns, and alien complexes as you take the fight to an unknown enemy. Solar Wind encompasses many elements of the classic side scrolling, shoot 'em ups. Blast asteroids, take on alien ships, upgrade your ship with numerous add-ons, and navigate the unknown in the retro-themed blaster.

Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe. Not many screw with an Operative captaining a Dreadnaught! Explore a dynamic and evolving galaxy Explore a unique sector of the galaxy in every game, with different 'monsters', ship components, quests, and even races Fight in the galactic war between the various alien races Battle hundreds of different enemy starships Build the coolest and deadliest starship in the galaxy Outfit your ship with thousands of components and crew Adventure with your friends with co-op multiplayer
4 The Elements is a 2D Action Platformer inspired by the best games of this genre from the 90s. Switch in real time between the four elements of nature to overcome challenges, acquire new abilities and defeat powerful bosses in beautifully crafted thematic stages. You control each of the four elements of nature, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water, that for some mysterious reason find themselves trapped inside a magic crystal and forced to share the same body. By switching between the characters on the fly, you will be able to use their different attacks, movement and abilities to face enemies, solve puzzles and unveil the truth behind their mutual predicament as they fight to escape from their imprisonment. Walk beautifully crafted environments that were formed by the elemental chaos raging within the crystal, each created from the clash of two of the primary elements. Traverse through Ice, Magma, Mud and Smoke as you face the challenges each of these stages present. The 4 elements have much of their power sealed away and scattered across these hostile domains. Look for the runes that contain their essences to empower the elements with new abilities. They will be essential to conquer the obstacles that stand in your way, both environmental and foes alike. Speaking of foes, at the end of each stage, a massive creature awaits. They serve as guardians to the 4 crystal keys the elements need in order to release themselves from their prison. Like the places they inhabit, these mighty beasts too were birthed from the coalescence of elemental forces and wield that power with unbridled fury. As such, each will present challenges that match and make use of their domains. Combine your skills with the knowledge and abilities acquired on the path to their lair to fell these giants and claim their keys.

In the pulsing neon heart of Cyberscape, the digital world of PROTOTYPE, a newborn consciousness flickered into existence. This was no ordinary creation - it was 07Vanguard, a prototype AI, coded with an ambitious purpose: to outlast an onslaught of menacing robot adversaries. A synthesized voice echoed within 07Vanguard's mind, an implanted guide and mentor: 'Defend yourself. Outmaneuver. Outfight. Outlast.' It imparted advanced combat techniques, strategies, and the knowledge of an arsenal embedded within the AI's very form. With each passing wave, the hostile robots grew stronger, their numbers swelling like an incoming tide. Steel bodies glimmered menacingly under the neon lights, each machine a unique adversary with distinct skills, weaknesses, and attack patterns. But 07Vanguard was not without advantages. As the tide of robotic enemies crashed against it, power-ups materialized around the arena, gifts of survival. Health packs to mend the AI's metallic body, weapon upgrades to enhance firepower, and shimmering bubbles of temporary invincibility pulsed with latent energy, waiting to be claimed. Victory was hard-won. Every fallen foe was replaced by another, the challenges escalating, pushing 07Vanguard to the edges of its programmed capabilities. And then, the Bosses emerged. These formidable titans dwarfed the rest, a deadly dance of steel and silicon that demanded everything the prototype AI had to offer. The fights were brutal, the victories exhilarating. With each vanquished Boss, 07Vanguard felt the rush of an encoded triumph, a software subroutine humming with satisfaction. And as the last of these behemoths crumbled, the digital world of Cyberscape resonated with a deep silence. The quiet held a question, one that echoed in 07Vanguard's circuits: Had it proven itself to be the ultimate AI warrior? The game was over, but the story of 07Vanguard, the victorious AI, was just beginning. The battleground was clear, but the echoes of its trials lingered, a testament to the struggle and triumph etched into the very code of the steel Vanguard.

There's no room for error when travelling at the speed of light, racing through star systems in a desperate search for a new world to house Mankind. But there are plenty of opportunities for mistakes. Alien races of every conceivable size, shape, temperament and sophistication seek to aid, use, corrupt or destroy you - and you don't know which. Sure, your starship is 15,000 feet long and armed with remote-controlled fightercraft, kamakazi fighters, a devestating plasma gun and high-tech probes, but will all that firepower be against The Stentor, rithless time-travelling space pirates, or the colossal energy beings known as The ZOR?

Ghostory is a 2D platformer designed around switching between physical and ghostly forms in order to solve increasingly taxing puzzles. Despite starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns. Ghostory won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016. In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form, they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow them to survive and escape the cave unscathed. The game comes packed with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls, always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles. Complex, occasionally fiendish puzzles. Dozens of unique levels. Smooth animations, and quality pixel art. Engagingly deep plot complete with rather silly puns. Atmospheric music to tie in with the detailed environments of each level. Smooth and responsive controls. Important mushrooms. In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods. Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will. Thankfully, an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote, but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.

A young man awakens in a forest, deep in the Hinodean wilds. He doesn't remember how he got there, or where he needs to be. Despite this, wielding a blade is all too familiar to him, and his knowledge of ancient history is greater than scholars that have studied their entire lives. On a quest to remember his past, the young man sets out, eager to find his way... Customize your heroes the way you want. The game contains 54 weapons, 150 different types of armor and accessories, and 92 unique skills and spells for the heroes to learn. Additionally, there are 54 gems to equip, which enhance the heroes' skills in different ways. The world is full of dangerous enemies, and each requires their own strategy. The Aranea Queen, for example, can trap someone in webs, and devour them instantly if they aren't freed in time! There are a number of status effects, bonuses, and penalties that will help or hinder you during the journey. If you are unsure what a status effect does, mouseover the character or monster, and all of their statuses will display descriptions. Additionally, use the Combat Log to check previous battles, or catch up on something you might've missed during the fight. Battles are turn-based, with unique mechanics. Powerful spells will take time to cast, and characters can use Free Actions, special skills that allow them to instantly act again. Some fights will grant the heroes temporary abilities, like the Assist command, which lets someone provide aid to their friends. No grinding. The game is a linear adventure focusing on battles, visual novel segments, and visiting merchants to resupply. Difficulty can be changed at any time, even during dialogue. Enemy aggro is based on a threat system. Characters that deal the most damage will have the enemy's attention. To help tweak aggro management in your favour, a variety of options are available, like the Ring of Pacifism, or the skill, Defensive Casting. Items have a number of different qualities and differences. Blades forged in Hinode, for example, increase their wielders' critical hit chance, while those made in Guinevere are far more accurate, and can damage an enemy's armour. The story is emotional and relatable, focusing on a group of friends that face hardships together, and how they change over time. Trials of Kokoro explores themes of family, facing one's past, coming to terms with the world's true nature, and the concept of trust. Characters Aedric Aedric awakens in a mysterious meadow, deep in the forests of Hinode. He doesn't remember anything before then, and is on a mission to remember who he is, and where he belongs. Aedric is incredibly naive about many things, and can be far too trusting of those he doesn't know. In battle, Aedric wears heavy armour and wields swords. Aedric can choose to carry a shield, which allows him to completely block incoming physical attacks, or he can forgo defense for greater attacking strength, choosing to fight with two-handed swords, instead. Aedric's powers allow him to add a variety of elemental effects to his strikes, and he has a number of spell-like abilities, as well. Rhea A young Sol-Ikati, Rhea meets Aedric while foraging for herbs, and immediately develops a friendship with him. Although immature at times, and quick to anger, Rhea is loyal to those she loves, and will often put herself in danger, without a second thought. In battle, Rhea fights with her fists, delivering quick strikes, which allow her to build stamina quickly. Rhea can encourage her allies, protecting them from fear and boosting their attack, or increase her own speed and evasion, allowing her to act more often than her friends. Athena Athena is a traveling healer from the Guineverian city of Berholven, A Favoured of Trestae, Goddess of the Stars, she seeks to atone for her mistakes. She is burdened by the guilt of her past, and is incredibly consumed with how the world, and her Goddess, perceives her. In battle, Athena is capable of treating the wounds of her allies, purging them of ailments, and bringing them back from the brink of death. Additionally, Athena possesses powerful prayers, which increase various aspects of her friends' offensive and defensive strengths. The First Game in the Legends of Vitaria Series

Fine China is a VR 'you-break-it-you-buy-it' simulator for the HTC Vive. Put on your oversized backpack and have make your way through an antique store. The faster you reach the register, the higher your score, but be careful not to break too much! Alternatively, let out your inner hooligan in Destruction mode where you do as much damage as possible in a set amount of time. The game is meant for roomscale and uses the WalkAbout locomotion system which allows you to rotate around your play area, independent of your position in game, so you never run out of room.

I'd recommend to try the free demo, which represents the finished game, but with limited content.
Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments. Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator. The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.

In the near future a new Exodus begins, the remnants of human civilization have to leave the perishing Earth and start traveling into the Psychosphere. The ones who call themselves the Spirits - new pastors of the human race, believe that a new planet, suitable for living, will be found in the Psychosphere. Colossal towns-arks, carrying hundreds of colonists, have been traveling for centuries through hostile worlds of Psychosphere under the guidance of Spirits. Their destination was the New Earth that was to replace their old home. All passed worlds have been connected by portals, that is how the Chain of Worlds has been created. But the end of the hard tests is not in sight, and finally due to the despotism of Spirits and the underground intrigues Exodus went to pieces. New factions have arisen - the Empire and the Harkback. Each faction had their own goals and philosophy. The Harkbacks believed that the old Earth has not died, and the Empire - the most mysterious faction - believed that humans should stay in the Chain of Worlds. The antagonism boiled into a war that has been going on for many decades in many worlds. Whereas the Spirits are on the way to their destination and the Harkbacks are seeking the mythical Earth, the Emperor builds up his Sponge Empire using automatic bases - his Vice Frames. He does not believe in the old or in the new Earth. Secretly the Emperor creates the Mechanical Spirit - a super mechanism to help him discover new Worlds. Only the Emperor's mortal foes the Spirits could discover new worlds, and that was the source of their power. But now the new time has come. One of the Vice frames starts testing this mechanism, it leads to the appearance of a super mind - Mechanical Messiah and the discovery of the parallel Chain of the Psycho-sphere Worlds. We also meet the 'lost' Exodus Frames and find traces of the mysterious alien race. The three sides are in the middle of the deadly battle: the Scourge against the Emperor's Slaves, Lash of the Spirits against the Calling of Messiah, a dead truth against a newborn lie. Who are the Spirits - savers or killers of the human race? Who is Messiah judge or a puppet? Who is the Emperor? Who will win? The player will find out the answer during the spectacular single player campaign in Perimeter: Emperor's Testament. 'I feel hungry tension of the highest spheres. Flesh and blood of the Sponge have been set in motion; they are pulsating around the world in which the Emperor is creating a new history of the great Chain.'

It's the year 2112. A hundred years following the apocalypse, humans quickly rebuilt a new world while developing science and technology. Earth, at this time, became a perfect Eden. Despite this, humans continued to be possessed of madness and desire. Wars, crime, and killings still continued. In 2113, due to the demand for new weapons of war, a program surrounding cybernetic technology was initiated. A group of specially selected girls was sent to a secret research facility for body modifications. In 2115, a mysterious meteorite from deep space was detected approaching the Solar System. Some scientists predicted it would hit the Earth in three years. Humans were so afraid that they tried everything they could to prevent this from happening. In 2116, analysis of the incoming meteorite revealed something even more frightening: the presence of many unknown life forms and suspected viral substances on the meteorite. Even if humanity survived the meteorite hitting the Earth, the world would be destroyed due to these mysterious life forms and viruses. Near the end of 2117, just before the meteorite is due to hit the Earth, three of the girls who had their bodies modified as weapons are sent, along with all the hopes of humanity, to destroy the meteorite and save mankind...

So What Is Meeple Station? Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem. Speaking of community, drop into our Discord and say hello! We love to hear from you all!

At night, it's time to pull out weapons, armor, and traps to explore the abandoned wine cellars, stunning sea caves, creepy catacombs, and deadly dungeon beneath Hero-U. Most combat is optional for those who prefer a pure adventure game, but there are ample rewards for those who choose to valorously fight the creatures that threaten the school and all of Sardonia.

Redefining Strategy in RTS games. Foresight is an epic space-based RTS game that throws you, the player, into the thick of the battle as a commander. Lead huge fleets, armed with fighters and bombers across wormholes to fight it out with your enemy. Launch bombing missions, fighter patrols, plant observation posts or fire support base with reconnaissance units. Intelligence is key. Recruit capable commanders as your fleet commanders; they'll not just obey your orders, they'll also talk to you, give you suggestions, raise requests and report on their progress. Fleets are semi-autonomous and therefore have their own command, which is separate from yours though they're under your command. This allows you to expand your forces beyond what you can control. They also progress alongside you, gaining experience and improving their abilities. As they get promoted in rank, so does your command; allow you to control more ships. Foresight redefines the strategy component of RTS games by rewarding players for executing correct strategic decisions and not punishing players for a single mis-click or being less dexterous. Build order complexity is minimized to allow players to focus on what matters; building the right thing. Need to arm a capital ship with fighters and bombers? No problem - simply make a request with that ship. Foresight's AI will automate the entire process - between picking the nearest shipyard with the lowest load and deployment to the designated ship. So, what's your battle plan? Blitzkrieg? Flank attack? Even in space, such plans are possible because Foresight is built to deliver an reasonably accurate outcome. A large navy may not always win the day. Finally, enjoy the epic battle as fighters dogfight each other, bombers performing bombing runs and ships firing all weapons in their full glory! Features Foresight supports up to 8 players in single player battles or multiplayer skirmishes. Create fleets with officers who will then talk to you and offer suggestions. Form massive fleets quickly without a complicated build tree. Reasonable automation eliminates the need to overly micro-manage RTS 'chores', now you can focus on the battle more. Tide of war can be tilted by intelligence gathering and positioning of ships, as well as having a healthy supply of fighters and bombers. The largest army may not always win. Every player is represented by an avatar character in game, making sneak attacks and assassinations worthwhile. Most of the 36 Strategems applicable and is highly replicable in Foresight Commanders and Advisors will level in their statistics gradually with action in combat and will unlock more innate abilities to aid you.

October 22, 2009 - Update Wargaming.net has released free Downloadable Content for Order of War. The DLC will download automatically the next time you launch the game. This DLC contains all the formerly exclusive pre-order items which include: Heavy Bomber Squadrons - Addition of German Arado and Allied B-24 Marauder heavy bomber units to air support Infantry Mortar Launchers - Addition of infantry mortar units Off-Map Heavy Artillery - Addition of heavy artillery strikes to the air support menu Survival Mission Mode - New survival mission mode where you fend off waves of attacking enemies for as long as possible   About Order of War In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once. Their names were Overlord and Bagration. Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory. Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different. In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America's finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army's seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it's one thing to make history, but quite another to change it. ...Do you have what it takes to command? Key features: Experience WWII warfare on an epic, cinematic stage; that truly captures the intensity and scale of the battlefield.

Water is now mankind's most precious resource, and conflict erupts wherever it flows. Only one bubble of the old capitalist world survives. The Queen of the World is the largest ship ever to grace the oceans, a colossal city at sea where the wealthy elite live in exile from the chaos which surrounds them. Onboard this stateless paradise the Five Founding Fathers set about pursuing their Cornucopian research unimpeded. The contempt of the outside world is offset by NanoCell Corporation, one of the five, who promise to develop nano-technology to purify sea water at the molecular level and make the deserts bloom with the food of the world. But as they move closer to their goal, the bitterness of fanatical Malthusians grows. The so called 'Neo Malthusians' timed their attack perfectly. 9.8 billion watched as they recast hope as hatred, following a prophecy to commit global genocide; drowning the planet with blood as they slash the worlds population to a mere half billion 'righteous souls'. A prophecy they will soon find themselves in a position to fulfill.

The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating allowing you to improve the area by improving public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. You are free to go at your own pace and take it easy. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.

Land Doctrine is a 3D sandbox strategy game. You can design tanks, manage research, equip infantry, set up infantry training, optimize production and build combined arms battalions to crush your enemies. You have complete freedom to customize your army and you will need both superior designing and logistical skills as well as masterful tactics to outsmart your opponents and triumph on the battlefield. The combat system is based on measuring anti-tank firepower against armor and anti-personnel firepower against infantry cover while the combat distance gradually decreases during the battle. The terrain affects the starting distance of engagement, cover and tank maneuverability. Side, rear or top armor is exposed to enemy fire when tanks are fighting in complex environments, like woods, urban areas or marshland. It is an accurate and clever yet immediate system designed around the idea of optimizing your divisions. Therefore, research is an important part of the game. You can develop new tank engines, suspension, guns and infantry weapons or improve industrial efficiency and training methods. You can design a new tank, set up a production line to produce it and increase the production capacity by capturing enemy cities. Proper training is essential for victory. Inadequate training will cause increased casualties, while good training will generate combat bonuses. The training capacity is also limited: optimize carefully. You can manage infantry equipment at the platoon level. Select small arms and heavy weapons to provide the necessary firepower, then unleash it to see your enemies vanquished! Main features: - Randomly generated maps - More than 2100 possible tank designs - Tech tree with 99 research projects - Customizable infantry equipment with 23 infantry weapons - Custom training doctrines

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? These features make Nowhere Prophet stand out Card-based tactical combat system New procedurally generated maps each game Find loot and recruit followers to build your deck Unlock new content across multiple playthroughs More than 300 cards for you to discover Indian infused electronica soundtrack A roguelike deck-building game Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.

Even though any resistance to this organization seemed hopeless, a small rebel movement organizes strikes against Oniken. One day, a ninja mercenary named Zaku offers his services to the resistance for unknown reasons. His moves are lethal and now he is the resistance's only hope. Oniken is an action platform game highly inspired by the 1980's, its games and its movies. You can see this not only in the graphics and sound design, but also in Oniken's story and difficulty. Don't Worry, You Will Die A Lot Of Times. Every copy of Oniken comes with digital versions of the game manual and the original soundtrack.

No jumping. Only falling. Serious Scramblers is a fast-paced vertical platformer where you can't jump. Descend through a hazardous pit and defeat a massive monster lurking in the deep in this small but unabashedly tough game! Fall your way through the super intense arcade action Randomized level generation Test your skills on challenging obstacles Unlock new characters - each with game changing abilities Get ready for the finale - MASSIVE BOSS FIGHT Mark your victory on the leaderboard Enjoy with some real sweet chip-tune music while playing the game Serious Scramblers features a colorful cast of unlock-able characters, each changing the game in significant ways. Here are some examples: Motoko - Time jumper Like a certain innovative FPS, time only moves when Motoko moves. There is a catch however, the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn't paused - so, unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes, you'll have to make each move carefully! Silhouette - Gotta go fast Silhouette moves at top speed at all times, so avoiding spike traps is as easy as A, B, and C! However, the trade-off is that there will be significantly lesser gold coins to collect. Mummy - Gold Grabber Fancy getting more coins to unlock more characters? Mummy's the one to choose. It's worth noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though! Serious Scramblers is a highly challenging, yet simple game originally released on the iOS. While it has gotten a modest number of downloads on the platform, less than 1 percent of players have beaten the final boss. This led me to wonder how gamers on Steam would fare. Consequently, I decided to port Serious Scramblers to the PC while using this opportunity to touch up various graphical aspects of the game. It is a tiny and simple game, but I poured my heart into it! If you like a challenge, consider getting this game! I welcome all forms of feedback on the Steam forums, discord, and twitter! Thank you!

Quanero is an experimental VR experience for the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift . Your goal is to figure out what caused a violent incident in a futuristic bar by manipulating the time. You can slow down time, reverse it or bring it to a halt. Explore the scene, unlock the story's branch points and unravel the mystery. There's also an explosion. Quanero was created with Unreal Engine 4 and can be downloaded for free. Background Information The possibility of experiencing stories in virtual reality offers completely new challenges to the art of storytelling. The traditional work of directing and the function of the cameraman have to be reconsidered completely, as the player is able to choose his point of view and position. We have tackled this challenge in our final bachelor project Quanero and even went one step further: in this experience, we also give the player complete control over the time. Thus, it is possible to move forward and backwards in time, to stop it or to view the action in slowmotion from every perspective in the room. We're offering the player a new and extremely immersive experience. The goal of the experience is to find the source of the devastating chain reaction which climaxes in an explosion. Quanero was developed specifically for HTC Vive. VR technology enables you to feel like you're in this futuristic bar, partaking in a brawl or a drug deal and finding yourself in a spectacular explosion with debris raining down on you. This project was created by students from the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg's MultiMediaArt and MultiMediaTechnology degree program. The content was created with several 3D applications and textured with the help of substance painter and designer. Body and facial expressions were acted out by professional actors and digitized with a motion capture system.

Absolutely Goode Championship is a game where you can either pilot a fast running marble as it competes, rolling downhill, on countless different tracks or just relax, watch and root for different marble teams competing against each other. Before the consumer electronics revolution, and for millennia, mostly what people had to play with were dice, cards, kites, wheels and marbles. Being, originally, nothing more than rounded pebbles, marbles were able to deliver a lot of fun in hours of playtime. One of the most fun and challenging marbles games was the downhill race, where players would spend hours planning, building and perfecting the race tracks in preparation for rooting for their 'teams', as they rushed downhill using gravity to accelerate towards the finish line. Fast forward to the 21st century and now people of all ages can sit and watch videos of such competitions, in elaborated scenarios, wishing, many times, they could be able to influence the races outcome. Absolutely Goode Championship grants you that wish. Design tracks or let the game do it for you and actively pilot any of 16 beautifully rendered marbles in Quick Races, compete in Championships on 10 different pre-rendered race tracks or just start an idle event and watch teams competing against each other, listening to an engaging theme song. Chose the best difficulty level to challenge your skills and prepare yourself to face a fierce competition... those marbles are not fooling around.

It is perfectly suitable for a person of any age and is safe and enjoyable for very young children. The movements of the glass eye player character in the game is purely physics driven. It can bounce around, jump, spin and bump into things. It is controlled using the WASD keys and space bar for jumping. The player looks through a single follow camera with a semi top down view on the glass eye and field of view can be adjusted by moving the camera in closer or further away from the eye. So you could set how much your see of the maze yourself and in doing so challenge yourself accordingly. Look carefully at sigils and markings on objects since they hold clues. Avoid patches of sand. That will dry the eye and eventually cause it to crack up and you lose the game. Keep the eye moisturized by rolling it through water puddles. You can exit the game at any time by pressing the escape key on your keyboard and you can pause the game by pressing P on your keyboard. There are no saving or checkpoint functions. The game was built in the Unreal Engine version 4.24.3 and all 3D modeling and texturing was done in Blender 2.80.

During the early 2000s, the living pumpkins were spotted for the first time in the forest of North Carolina. There were many conspiracy theories regarding the mysterious appearance of the Living Pumpkins also known by the name 'Pumpkin Man' or 'Pumpkin bots'. It was assumed that these Pumpkin Bots were some sort of extraterrestrial beings who appeared for the very first time during the Halloween Night. However, they were secretly building their underground military base somewhere in the US. It was reported that they were building modern warships and turrets in secrecy. As soon as the US Government came to know about that secret underground base the US navy had been instructed to take a deep dive into the matter. In 2018, some of the US battleships were attacked by a few Pumpkin Head battleships which resulted in the war breaking out between the US military forces and the Pumpkin Bots. On the Halloween Night, the US Navy launched the modern warship called 'USS Special' to destroy the Pumpkin secret bases, battleships, turrets and the bots to reinstate peace in the world. Who will win in the end? Key Features: 20 Levels to Play! Different kinds of battleships and turrets. Four firing modes including primary, secondary, tertiary and missile. Challenging situations and hard to master. Easier controls. Note: I am a solo developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, artwork, programming except for the music. Thank you!

Canvas Quest is a turn-based JRPG made in RPGMaker MV. The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered. This game is over three years old now, and I've appreciated every individual fan! You all mean the world to me, and who knows? You might want to keep an eye out for something special very soon!

Proteus is a game about exploration and immersion in a dream-like island world where the soundtrack to your play is created by your surroundings.

The procedurally generated islands are home to creatures natural and imagined, tranquil valleys and ruins with magical properties. Key Features: Meditative play: the responsive world and lack of any text or hints distils an essence of curious, investigative play, and rewards patience and immersion. Dynamic soundtrack composed by award-winning musician David Kanaga follows the mood of the world and will appeal to fans of Boards of Canada, Brian Eno. A distinctive 2D-but-3D graphical style with wild shifting palettes that sits somewhere between 8-bit videogames and early 20th century modernist painting.

Built-in 'postcard' function encodes world data into each screenshot, allowing islands and discoveries to be saved and shared.
Stirring Abyss is an indie tactical squad-based game with strong RPG elements in which you uncover the ancient mysteries of the depths depicted in the classic vein of Lovecraftian horror. You take charge of the surviving crew of the USS Salem, a U.S. Navy submarine that sinks while on a top secret research mission during the early years of the Cold War. They find themselves surrounded by the ruins of a forgotten civilization, their vessel too badly damaged to escape the seabed. In Story Mode, you slowly unravel the mysteries of the depths in a desperate quest to rescue your missing crewmembers and fix the crippled Salem. The choices you make determine the fate of your crew - and the entire world. Every expedition lives or dies by the strength of its crew. You have a diverse array of character traits and skills at your disposal, each opening exciting new options in both combat and in story events. As you delve ever deeper, you may also subject your crew to powerful but grisly mutations; the price of survival is high, and no one escapes the abyss unchanged. The horror and the void which hide in deep waters can become too much to bear, and your crew may experience episodes of exhaustion and insanity. Will their psyche get stronger, or will it be forever damaged? A game of dice with Fate itself will determine the outcome. Salvaged resources can be turned into weapons, armor, or other useful supplies - or they can be used to repair and upgrade the Salem, giving your crew a crucial edge in the fight for survival. The more you explore the abyss during the missions, the more chances you have to find the lost treasures of the deep. The hauntingly beautiful environment holds many secrets and mysteries to explore, but danger lurks just outside the feeble circles of light you bring with you. Be wise, and use your skills to scout the black waters and light up the path: unseen terrors may be hiding just out of sight. The Endless Mode pits your crew in a roguelike battle against an army of neverending enemies that only grow stronger as you progress.
