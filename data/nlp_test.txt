A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration. Explore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters. There are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened. You will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. The game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.

The game builds up story and mechanics throughout it's 3-4 hour playtime until the end. Story Ophelia Delaney is a young woman haunted by the early childhood she spent with her parents in the town of Alder Stow. The Delaney family owned a large estate for generations, which was used for many things during the 20th century. All the horrible events that took place there remain unknown. Ophelia was forced to leave town and move to her aunt who raised her. Now, 10 years later, she is tormented by images from the past, suppressed memories and lucid dreams. Those closest to her suggested increasingly radical treatments. After those failed, Ophelia was sure that she can only be cured where she was born. She must return to the Delaney Institution. Gameplay The pillars of classic survival horror are alive and well in Eldervale. You must explore and navigate creepy environments with the help of maps and consumables you collect.

About the Project As a solo developer and a devout fan of survival horror, Eldervale is a passion project with the goal of reinvigorating a genre I feel is underrepresented in today's market. That said, Eldervale is much more than just paying respects to the classics : It puts it's own twist on the genre, making it more accessible to new players as well as nostalgic for veterans. I hope you will enjoy, so I can continue putting hard work in for a genre I love.

The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart. So did the people. They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too worn by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven successful. The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...

Shoot, propel, and pogo your way through dozens of challenging levels to fulfill Blot's destiny! Loads of levels! Strange, yet oddly charming, boss fights! A unique, physics-based way of movement. Quirky humor and jokes. Is this a plus? I honestly don't know. It's a hard game. Both a pro and a con! STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS TO PROVE YOUR TERRIBLE TENDENCY TO BE A COMPLETIONIST! Gatlin' is a physics-based platforming bullet hell where you are the bullet hell! Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying. You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right. I hear you asking, 'What causes me to die?' That is an oddly-morbid question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die to tears. By the way, that last thing is both figurative and literal . The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to. Each boss also reveals c r i s p y lore and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I guess. The endgame of Gatlin' is a distinctive twist on the existing gameplay. After the conclusion of the main story, level modifiers are unlocked. Want levels to be more difficult? We've got you covered. Imagine Hell itself. Good work. Now imagine Hell without gravity and now every surface is covered in soap. Get the picture? Does Hell not sound appealing enough for you? Understandable, everyone's a critic. Instead, we offer a wide array of eccentric and ever-expanding levels, worlds, and challenges to partake in. Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind. If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said, we highly encourage speedrunning .

Stirring Abyss is an indie tactical squad-based game with strong RPG elements in which you uncover the ancient mysteries of the depths depicted in the classic vein of Lovecraftian horror. You take charge of the surviving crew of the USS Salem, a U.S. Navy submarine that sinks while on a top secret research mission during the early years of the Cold War. They find themselves surrounded by the ruins of a forgotten civilization, their vessel too badly damaged to escape the seabed. In Story Mode, you slowly unravel the mysteries of the depths in a desperate quest to rescue your missing crewmembers and fix the crippled Salem. The choices you make determine the fate of your crew - and the entire world. Every expedition lives or dies by the strength of its crew. You have a diverse array of character traits and skills at your disposal, each opening exciting new options in both combat and in story events. As you delve ever deeper, you may also subject your crew to powerful but grisly mutations; the price of survival is high, and no one escapes the abyss unchanged. The horror and the void which hide in deep waters can become too much to bear, and your crew may experience episodes of exhaustion and insanity. Will their psyche get stronger, or will it be forever damaged? A game of dice with Fate itself will determine the outcome. Salvaged resources can be turned into weapons, armor, or other useful supplies - or they can be used to repair and upgrade the Salem, giving your crew a crucial edge in the fight for survival. The more you explore the abyss during the missions, the more chances you have to find the lost treasures of the deep. The hauntingly beautiful environment holds many secrets and mysteries to explore, but danger lurks just outside the feeble circles of light you bring with you. Be wise, and use your skills to scout the black waters and light up the path: unseen terrors may be hiding just out of sight. The Endless Mode pits your crew in a roguelike battle against an army of neverending enemies that only grow stronger as you progress. It is the ultimate test of strategic ability, as you not only choose how to improve your own squad, but also pick your poison as to what powers your foes gain.

It's all about gaining a feel for the conservation of angular momentum: crouch to spin faster, extend to spin slower. Your Goal Just ski to the cabin. Learning Curve Like learning to ride a bike, Just Ski is going to feel clunky and impossible in the beginning, but once mastered will feel smooth and rewarding with just the right amount of challenge to keep things interesting. -Have fun and thanks for playing!

Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy. His only real taste of action is the training he has just signed up for. When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way. Canvas Quest is a game where experimentation is heavily encouraged. New spells and moves that characters learn may be useless. They may only be useful in certain situations or when paired up with other moves or spells. They may even be super powerful and useful. It's up to the player to determine what works best, as nothing is certain to tell you the best strategy. Sure, you have slimes and bats, but those aren't your only foes! How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered. This game is over three years old now, and I've appreciated every individual fan! You all mean the world to me, and who knows? You might want to keep an eye out for something special very soon!
