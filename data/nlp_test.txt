The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained: the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart. So did the people. They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too worn by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven successful. The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...

Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator. Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask. The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper. Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia. Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort. All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health. Always contact a specialist!

Majestic and luxurious, its interior resembles a mixture of the Ritz, the Chrysler building, Tutankhamen's tomb and Venice. Starship Titanic is a technological marvel.

You discover that you can communicate with them, a feat that is made possible by SpookiTalk, the games proprietary interactive language engine. You can chat with any of the robot characters-Fentible the distinguished Doorbot, Nobby the hypochondriac Liftbot, or Fortilian Bantoburn O'Perfluous the outrageously convivial Barbot. Talk to them, interrogate them. Give them orders. They will listen to you, answer you and, if they happen to feel like it, obey you. Sometimes. To begin with you are a third-class passenger, and you quickly find yourself in the grip of one of the most powerful forces known to man-the desire for a free upgrade. As you move up to second and, at last, to first class, more and more of the ship becomes accessible to you, and more and more of its mysteries are revealed. What has happened here? What terrible events occurred the night before the launch? Who is the mysterious Titania whose brooding statues dominate the ship? Can you solve a series of increasingly bizarre and surreal puzzles., unlock the central mystery and return to Earth before the parrot drives you finally and irrevocably mad? Features- All original interactive characters and game design by Douglas Adams, creator of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level. IMMERSION AWAITS Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions. VARIETY AWAITS URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours. ENIGMAS AWAIT URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles. AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.

Paving the way for future installments, this single screen puzzle platformer impressed with its high quality graphics and mind-twisting levels. Retro KING MAN Released in 1990, Retro KING MAN changed the gameplay quite a bit, as players could explore large maps to find upgrades for the KING MAN.

Super KING MAN Released in 1992, Super KING MAN brought the titular hero to a new generation of fans, with even sillier humor and over the top voice samples. The game was groundbreaking for its full-screen pixelation effects, the use of widescreen and iconic voice acting. Rounding out this spectacular package is a documentary about the full history of the series, how it started and how it all fell apart. Experience and enjoy these wonderful classics from an era that never was for the first time since their original release and dive into the world of the KING MAN - metaphorically, of course. ------------------------------- Controller Information: This game is compatible with a wide range of gamepads.

A puzzle game bound to test your ability to think out of the box. Deadly rotating blades. Bottomless ditches of death. And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned 3-in-1 mind games playing, cold blooded killing machine, and psycho-lunatic of a lady. The Puppet Master is a puzzle game that is bound to test your ability to think out of the box. While being severely limited in many aspects by the fact that you're imprisoned in half a pound of cotton and felt made into the vague likeness of a human being, you are otherwise granted the Hogwarts worthy ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. A skill that, if used well, just might save your life. An exhaustive amount of meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions are vital in the survival of the game. Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back. It's a game of control or be controlled. AMS Game Development Association The Puppet Master is distributed under the AMS Game Development Association, a student run game development club located in the University of British Columbia. Every year, members of AGDA get together and make new games, mixing in our collective talent and creative efforts to make fun, engaging games that are hard to put down.

Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself.

More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum. Features: Hilariously Irreverent Campaign Mode Splitscreen Zombie Survival Mode Collectible Intel Trading Cards Full Controller Support Coming Eventually: Co-op Campaign Steam Stats and Leaderboards Multilanguage Support

You are the glass eye of a very forgetful explorer. Deep inside an ancient ruin, somewhere in a lost world behind the Bermuda Triangle known as the World of Clouds, you were removed and left behind all alone. Now you must uncover the secrets of the maze and find a way out by yourself. EyeRoll is extremely simple and relaxing to play. You are rolling a glass eye through a maze and must uncover secrets and solve puzzles to find your way out. It is recommended you play with a mouse that has a scroll wheel since you can use that to move the follow camera closer to objects of interest in order to study them so they can serve as clues as to how to find a way out of the maze. It is perfectly suitable for a person of any age and is safe and enjoyable for very young children. The movements of the glass eye player character in the game is purely physics driven. It can bounce around, jump, spin and bump into things. It is controlled using the WASD keys and space bar for jumping. The player looks through a single follow camera with a semi top down view on the glass eye and field of view can be adjusted by moving the camera in closer or further away from the eye. So you could set how much your see of the maze yourself and in doing so challenge yourself accordingly. Look carefully at sigils and markings on objects since they hold clues. Avoid patches of sand. That will dry the eye and eventually cause it to crack up and you lose the game. Keep the eye moisturized by rolling it through water puddles. You can exit the game at any time by pressing the escape key on your keyboard and you can pause the game by pressing P on your keyboard. There are no saving or checkpoint functions. The game was built in the Unreal Engine version 4.24.3 and all 3D modeling and texturing was done in Blender 2.80.

Year 1442, Unified Calendar The world has been plunged into a devastating state of chaos, as two mighty powers wage war for supremacy. The Vollcross Empire, a brutal fascist regime, has launched a surprise invasion of the Kazanov Union, intent on eradicating the perceived communist threat. In the early days of the war, the Empire's forces were unstoppable, crushing opposition with ruthless efficiency. But as the Union mobilized its vast population and fought back, the Empire's supply lines began to falter, and the once certain victory began to slip away. The fate of the war now rests on Khaligrad, a key city that holds the precious oil fields both sides desperately need. The Union forces have dug in and are putting up fierce resistance, turning the battle into a brutal and prolonged conflict. Welcome to a place where war is the only truth, where victory is the only option. Welcome to the front, officer. Choose your side Khaligrad offers you 2 challenging campaigns. Will you fight for the Empire, a formidable invader with limited supplies and distant support? Or will you stand with the Union, the motherland boasting vast armies but struggling with inferior equipment? Face the Men... Whether it's securing a strategic point, defending an ammunition stockpile or simply eradicating the enemy, every mission in the campaign involves combat. You will lead several squads of soldiers of various quality and morale in a turn-based tactical battle. Ambush your opponents and use the terrain to your advantage to ensure victory. Urban guerrilla warfare is no easy playground. ... and the War In Khaligrad, the greatest adversary is not the enemy, but the harshness of war itself. Between missions, you'll need to care for your wounded, feed, heat and equip your men. But resources are scarce and winter is getting steadily harsher. Difficult choices lie ahead. Tell your own story Depending on your successes and failures during the campaign, your story evolves and takes different directions. The missions entrusted to you by your HQ evolve accordingly. Will you become a so-called hero who always manages to repel the enemy despite numbers? Or will you end up in front of a firing squad for incompetence?
40 miles under the Earth's surface, a hazardous research and refinery facility has faulted. Attempts to raise communication with the installment have failed. The status of all fifteen workers stationed within the facility is unknown. Valvorta Industries, the controversial energy corporation responsible for the site, must maintain discretion. In response, Valvorta's BoD has elected to dispatch an engineering specialist to assess the situation. The mission is simple: recover information, restore output from the facility and rescue the workers trapped under earth. Traversal through the facility will not be easy. The malfunctioning systems have made the descent near impossible. The high temperatures and the lack of breathable oxygen require the use of a specialized suit. You'll need a sharp eye to find any tools, lifts, documentation, and devices scattered across the facility, and a bright mind to put them to use. Extra attention must be paid to maintaining your suit's battery and air levels if you wish to survive. To make your mission easier, your suit provides a gauge on your current status, a log of any documents you find scattered about, magnetic boot attachments function for situational vertical and upside-down movement, and an instant connection to all terminals requiring rudimentary programming skills. Find whatever information you can and piece together the events leading to the loss in communications. After that, it will be up to you to decide what needs to be done.
