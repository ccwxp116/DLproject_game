Stephanie ' Watts ' Watson , an aspiring bassist , bounced from audition to audition never finding music that really resonated with her , that is , until she discovered the magic of funk . Caught up in the groove , she recruits a group of hometown amateurs to take on art school darlings La Tormenta at the Battle of the Bands . Time - based sokoban - style puzzles Character - driven story set in 1 9 9 0 s suburban America Strategy - esque squad resources and rewindable turns to optimize your solutions Sequenced combo moves and 4 0 levels of strategic madness Join Watts as she grows on a musical journey rooted in funk and fusion . Soulful grooves and hot licks are composed by Pete Fraser , session saxophonist to the The Pogues , Friendly Fires , and Field Music ! Twenty musical motifs are recorded by a live ensemble of seven funk masters , providing the foundation for the dynamic music in the game . Unique songs are generated depending on what directions and paths you take in each puzzle . Customize your performance with alternate playing styles , instruments swaps , and realtime audio effect pedals . Each character in your band moves through the sokoban puzzle maps in different ways , encountering unique solutions and obstacles . Advancing a character consumes a turn and part of the timeline , setting up interactions with other characters and enemies at different points in time . Rewinding a turn undoes your move , allowing you to find improved solutions and new ways to tackle problems . Manipulate each character separately , rewinding or fast - forwarding along the timeline in the process to reach her current point in time . Changes in time are reflected in the progress and actions both past and present of each character , creating some possibilities and removing others . Each character has his own resource - limited super move which can be triggered under certain conditions . Tip toe through tight spaces with your bassist , slide through guards with your keytar player , break through walls with your drummer , or blow enemies out of the way with your mighty super sax . Strategic use of your super moves increase the number of solutions to each puzzle and are the key in gaining a maximum score . Four resource - based musical metrics govern how and when you can move and interact with objects in the levels . These can completely block progress if used inefficiently , and create amazing musical chains and high scores when regulated artfully . Backbeat is a homage to the 1 6 and 3 2 - bit story - driven games of the 1 9 9 0 s , recreating the challenges and victories of the last days of analog life and the birth of the internet . The suburban Washington D . C . area is reflected in diner parking lots , shopping malls , and dimly lit arcades . A colorful cast of supporting characters both friend and foe join Watts as she struggles with leadership , success , and holding together a band .

Anomalies may be a game , then again it may not . One user described it as ' A million musical leeches , waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain . ' Another said ' I don ' t even know what to say about this one . It honestly freaked me out a little . ' A particularly enthusiastic user stated ' Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing . . . I ' m pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe . ' A Fine Art Game Anomalies is an experimental generative art game . There are no levels , points or objectives . It is a ' game ' in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime , an interactive piece of audio - visual , virtual sculpture , which one can tinker around with and explore . Generate and Explore You can randomly generate the anomalies , or you can change the anomaly ' s parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation . Use the controls to explore Anomalies , and the unique sights and sounds they generate . Sights and Sounds Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena , the parameters that effect one effect the other . Some are strange and discordant entities , while others are symmetrical and harmonious . All the images and ' songs ' you hear in the demo video were produced through the program ' s algorithms . Other Options Using a built in screen capture button , you can collect snapshots of your handiwork . Use it as desktop wallpaper , or share it with your friends . If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly , you can also save it and load it again later . There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically , allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show . Experimental I call Anomalies ' experimental ' because of the way in which I developed it . I started with a simple idea - ' what would trees look like if they grew in space ? ' - and began to create fairly simple , branching structures . Once that was working , I thought about different colors and textures . Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - ' what if they move or wiggle ? What it they make sounds ? What if they produce flames or particles ? ' - and so on , until I arrived at what you see in the program . So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it . Though I have moved on to other projects , I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies . I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point , but I will not give any promises right now . . .

No jumping . Only falling . Serious Scramblers is a fast - paced vertical platformer where you can ' t jump . Descend through a hazardous pit and defeat a massive monster lurking in the deep in this small but unabashedly tough game ! Fall your way through the super intense arcade action Randomized level generation Test your skills on challenging obstacles Unlock new characters - each with game changing abilities Get ready for the finale - MASSIVE BOSS FIGHT Mark your victory on the leaderboard Enjoy with some real sweet chip - tune music while playing the game Serious Scramblers features a colorful cast of unlock - able characters , each changing the game in significant ways . Here are some examples : Motoko - Time jumper Like a certain innovative FPS , time only moves when Motoko moves . There is a catch however , the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn ' t paused - so , unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes , you ' ll have to make each move carefully ! Silhouette - Gotta go fast Silhouette moves at top speed at all times , so avoiding spike traps is as easy as A , B , and C ! However , the trade - off is that there will be significantly lesser gold coins to collect . Mummy - Gold Grabber Fancy getting more coins to unlock more characters ? Mummy ' s the one to choose . It ' s worth noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though ! Serious Scramblers is a highly challenging , yet simple game originally released on the iOS . While it has gotten a modest number of downloads on the platform , less than 1 percent of players have beaten the final boss . This led me to wonder how gamers on Steam would fare . Consequently , I decided to port Serious Scramblers to the PC while using this opportunity to touch up various graphical aspects of the game . It is a tiny and simple game , but I poured my heart into it ! If you like a challenge , consider getting this game ! I welcome all forms of feedback on the Steam forums , discord , and twitter ! Thank you !

More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency , funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window , and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May . . . It ' s NotCoD : Call of Judy . From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side - scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St . Bumley on the Taint . An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games , NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes , mini - games , jokes , achievements , stats , jokes , intel and Easter Eggs . And also there are jokes . All of the art is hand drawn , every sound effect made with just our voices , and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3 - 4 hour single player campaign . NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic ' console but better ' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return , and arguably less crying .

To be fair , there ' s an option to turn the swearing off , but it really doesn ' t make the game any less offensive . If anything , your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote . Lovingly cartooned , bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum . Features : Hilariously Irreverent Campaign Mode Splitscreen Zombie Survival Mode Collectible Intel Trading Cards Full Controller Support Coming Eventually : Co - op Campaign Steam Stats and Leaderboards Multilanguage Support
