Are ghosts real? You are on your first solo ghost hunting case, under the watchful instructions of Bear and Jen from the O.P.G paranormal team. Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views. Full 360 exploration and soundtrack recorded on location. Interact with ghost-hunting gadgets to investigate. Encounter real-world paranormal activity based on witness statements.

2048AD - the year in which humanity was faced with bio-terrorism. The desire to reach the next stage of evolution, which ran contrary to the facts of nature, formed the study of illegal modification to human cells.

Players must overcome puzzles, traps, elite units, boss fights, and other various obstacles while navigating the field. Grow stronger through rewards earned, to uncover the truth of this world. 　 Synopsis One day, humanity became extinct due to an enormous explosion. Not a single entity was left to pass on the reason behind the extinction, nor to remember those who had disappeared. After what seemed an eternity, you have awoken in the midst of traces of a past human civilization. As you wander aimlessly, you encounter various records left behind by humans and beings who assist you. Will you be able to uncover the secret of this world and face the truth? 　 Features Fast-tempo battles with added strategical elements ASCENXION is an action shoot 'em up game, but in order to give the player a combat experience that differs from bullet hell games, we decided to make choices and concentration key gameplay points, instead of simply avoiding enemy bullets and attacking all over the place. There are a variety of strategic elements such as terrain cover, reduced movement speed during basic attacks, and mutual sharing of resources consumed by attack and evasion skills. Also, players must use basic attacks, skills, and items' active effects to defeat enemies. Get items through exploration Players can explore unknown lands to acquire dozens of distinctive items. Items are divided into 'rune stones', which combine weapons and use effects, and general items which provide basic lasting effects and experience bonuses. Elements of Development Important concepts in ASCENXION are 'unleashing potential' and 'skills'. Each aircraft type has four skills, and from the second skill, they will be unlocked upon defeating boss monsters that you encounter during the game. Skills You can only select one of two skills for each stage, but you can change your choice at any time. You need smarts and a good gamer mind to change your skills according to the situation, whether it be the terrain or enemy type! Unleashing Potential ASCENXION has a main character with some great power sealed inside. Of course, this great power can be unleashed. By completing an event that you will inevitably encounter during the game, you can unleash this power, and when this power is unleashed, modifications are made to its skills and overall stats that suit an aircraft of such great power. Each unleashed aircraft has a different play style, so choose the one you like, and keep leveling it up!

Quanero is an experimental VR experience for the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift . Your goal is to figure out what caused a violent incident in a futuristic bar by manipulating the time. You can slow down time, reverse it or bring it to a halt. Explore the scene, unlock the story's branch points and unravel the mystery. There's also an explosion. Quanero was created with Unreal Engine 4 and can be downloaded for free. Background Information The possibility of experiencing stories in virtual reality offers completely new challenges to the art of storytelling. The traditional work of directing and the function of the cameraman have to be reconsidered completely, as the player is able to choose his point of view and position. We have tackled this challenge in our final bachelor project Quanero and even went one step further: in this experience, we also give the player complete control over the time. Thus, it is possible to move forward and backwards in time, to stop it or to view the action in slowmotion from every perspective in the room. We're offering the player a new and extremely immersive experience. The goal of the experience is to find the source of the devastating chain reaction which climaxes in an explosion. Quanero was developed specifically for HTC Vive. VR technology enables you to feel like you're in this futuristic bar, partaking in a brawl or a drug deal and finding yourself in a spectacular explosion with debris raining down on you. This project was created by students from the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg's MultiMediaArt and MultiMediaTechnology degree program. The content was created with several 3D applications and textured with the help of substance painter and designer. Body and facial expressions were acted out by professional actors and digitized with a motion capture system.

Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator. Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask. The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper. Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia. Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort. All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health. Always contact a specialist!

At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.

COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.

Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.

STORY In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form. Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is commonplace. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing everyday people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive. Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications. Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study. You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company. THE GAME The subject is a sci-fi puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements and visual aesthetics of early 80s sci-fi. You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various testing rooms set out in the experiment and collect items needed to progress through the maze. You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by euthanization. Features Puzzles Collection Casual Mode Twitch Integration Stealth Survival

When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level.

The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach. URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.

You take command of the US Marines and will test your ability to do better than those brave Marines did back in 1945. Realistic battle depiction Each turn in the game represents one day with each day broken into phases. In each phase you get to move, support, or attack following a strategy that has to combine enemy lines penetration, HQ communication lines, and overall support for the units that are in heavy contact with the enemy. Units are approximately company-sized. A challenging strategic problem Be warned this is not an easy game to win. You will need to exercise Command and Control over your units by keeping them in range of their HQ to retain their effectiveness in battle. Armor should be used in a supporting role and not in the front lines otherwise the Japanese will eat them for breakfast. Troops need to rest and not be constantly engaged in combat. Numbers are on your side but the enemy has strong defensive positions and amazing fighting ability. Make the most of your resources Use the support points on units that are likely to be fired upon by the Japanese, especially when moving, to reduce your losses. Keep your units fatigue levels low by resting them from combat as they will become less effective as they keep on fighting.

You've always dreamed of becoming pro wrestling's biggest star...but a wrestler's world is fraught with hardship and betrayal, in and out of the ring. Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success. But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly. This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever. Slammed! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices control the story.

When's the last time you played a pro-wrestling RPG with a 'kayfabe' stat?--or where your trash-talking 'promo' ability is as important as your core strength and wrestling technique? Enjoy a 250,000-word personal tale of friendship, competition, and revenge. Develop not only your physical abilities, but a favored wrestling style. Become a heroic face, or a villainous heel--or even turn heel. Turn a scripted match into a real fight--and vice versa. Decide when to keep kayfabe, and when to break it.

TinShift is a dynamic first-person shooter arena. We inspired by Quake, UT and Titanfall. It's based on plausible shooting, wall running and sweaty armpits. 10 types of weapons are available. Some are classic, others will have to be used wisely and according to the situation. 1 map for 20 players with palm trees and vertical gameplay. You can climb anywhere. The second class is robots. It's for those who are tired of running around and just want to blow everything around. Return in time is a thing. Due to the excessive dynamics, it is often not possible to immediately respond to a surprise attack or a stray sniper bullet. We understand this and therefore everyone has a second chance - to change the course of events with a rollback 10 seconds back. Chance recharges when you successfully kill an enemy. And for dessert: NOT BATTLE ROYAL. Unexpected, right? We ourselves are tired of crawling across the field for 40 minutes until a bush kills you. We invite you to take part in the Leadership Race. Every man for himself from the start, but to win you become ALONE against EVERYBODY. There is no need to wait for a new match. Dropping by into the server in the middle of the game, you are in the same conditions as the experienced players. After finish, the match will restart automatically. It's non-stop. We play together with you! We are constantly in touch with the players on Discord and make a dream game together.
More offensive than a Donald Trump presidency, funnier than a toddler walking into a plate glass window, and ruder than a Hard Brexit up your Theresa May... It's NotCoD: Call of Judy. From the acclaimed team behind NotGTAV comes this extremely British side-scrolling run and gun romp through the quaint country parish of St. Bumley on the Taint. An affectionate parody of the world famous Call of Duty games, NotCoD is crammed to the eyeballs with jokes, mini-games, jokes, achievements, stats, jokes, intel and Easter Eggs. And also there are jokes. All of the art is hand drawn, every sound effect made with just our voices, and we even did our own versions of Zombies and Online Multiplayer that unlock as you progress through the 3-4 hour single player campaign. NotCoD is fully controller compatible for that authentic 'console but better' PC experience and comes with more options than a Tax Return, and arguably less crying. WARNING: NotCoD has quite a lot of, shall we say, colourful language and adult themes. To be fair, there's an option to turn the swearing off, but it really doesn't make the game any less offensive. If anything, your brain tends to fill in the bleeps with something more disgusting than we originally wrote. Lovingly cartooned, bizarrely voiced and not one to play with your mum. Features: Hilariously Irreverent Campaign Mode Splitscreen Zombie Survival Mode Collectible Intel Trading Cards Full Controller Support Coming Eventually: Co-op Campaign Steam Stats and Leaderboards Multilanguage Support

So What Is Meeple Station? Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem. Speaking of community, drop into our Discord and say hello! We love to hear from you all!

Yes, your toolbox is alive, and he's kind of a green cat blimp thing powered by pink farts. He doesn't seem to mind when you pull off one of his tails or yank a pin out of his head.

40 miles under the Earth's surface, a hazardous research and refinery facility has faulted. Attempts to raise communication with the installment have failed. The status of all fifteen workers stationed within the facility is unknown. Valvorta Industries, the controversial energy corporation responsible for the site, must maintain discretion. In response, Valvorta's BoD has elected to dispatch an engineering specialist to assess the situation. The mission is simple: recover information, restore output from the facility and rescue the workers trapped under earth. Traversal through the facility will not be easy. The malfunctioning systems have made the descent near impossible. The high temperatures and the lack of breathable oxygen require the use of a specialized suit. You'll need a sharp eye to find any tools, lifts, documentation, and devices scattered across the facility, and a bright mind to put them to use. Extra attention must be paid to maintaining your suit's battery and air levels if you wish to survive. To make your mission easier, your suit provides a gauge on your current status, a log of any documents you find scattered about, magnetic boot attachments function for situational vertical and upside-down movement, and an instant connection to all terminals requiring rudimentary programming skills. Find whatever information you can and piece together the events leading to the loss in communications. After that, it will be up to you to decide what needs to be done.

SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy. The current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot. See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for an FAQ and links to more information. If you're wondering where the MacOS X port went, see that FAQ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags, but the non-Steam MacOS will continue to work, and I'll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully!

One day, a mysterious package reaches the hero, who is harried by daily life as an adult. Inside the package was a pillow-shaped machine and a letter asking for help. Upon activating the pillow, the hero falls into a waking dream. Forgotten memories from childhood... Even these were but the opening act of the miracle about to begin. After its release in 2015, Yumeiri received acclaim from game magazines, science fiction magazines, and mystery novel magazines. With a very high difficulty, and it gave rise to not a few frustrated players. At the same time, players who accepted its concept of 'taming luck' were impressed as if personally reliving a dramatic life. For the full-scale remake, all scenarios were rethought and some episodes were rewritten. While the original was available only in Japanese, the game has now been produced with a full-scale English version.

Absolutely Goode Championship is a game where you can either pilot a fast running marble as it competes, rolling downhill, on countless different tracks or just relax, watch and root for different marble teams competing against each other. Before the consumer electronics revolution, and for millennia, mostly what people had to play with were dice, cards, kites, wheels and marbles. Being, originally, nothing more than rounded pebbles, marbles were able to deliver a lot of fun in hours of playtime. One of the most fun and challenging marbles games was the downhill race, where players would spend hours planning, building and perfecting the race tracks in preparation for rooting for their 'teams', as they rushed downhill using gravity to accelerate towards the finish line. Fast forward to the 21st century and now people of all ages can sit and watch videos of such competitions, in elaborated scenarios, wishing, many times, they could be able to influence the races outcome. Absolutely Goode Championship grants you that wish. Design tracks or let the game do it for you and actively pilot any of 16 beautifully rendered marbles in Quick Races, compete in Championships on 10 different pre-rendered race tracks or just start an idle event and watch teams competing against each other, listening to an engaging theme song. Chose the best difficulty level to challenge your skills and prepare yourself to face a fierce competition... those marbles are not fooling around.

Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe. Not many screw with an Operative captaining a Dreadnaught! Explore a dynamic and evolving galaxy Explore a unique sector of the galaxy in every game, with different 'monsters', ship components, quests, and even races Fight in the galactic war between the various alien races Battle hundreds of different enemy starships Build the coolest and deadliest starship in the galaxy Outfit your ship with thousands of components and crew Adventure with your friends with co-op multiplayer

'You are outgunned. You are massively outnumbered. You must win.' These are your orders. Humanity has already fought its war against the machines -- and lost. AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole, the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles, and the AIs have turned their attention outward, away from the galaxy, to alien threats or opportunities unknown. This inattention is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it's too late. You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs, but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores. Go forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down.
