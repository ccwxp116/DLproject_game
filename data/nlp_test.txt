A single player third person detective adventure RPG set in Egypt at the time of the building of the pyramids. While the game is primarily a quest game in which you have to follow clues you get from conversations to find your daughter who has been kidnapped by slave traders, it does contain elements of combat and exploration. Explore 40 valleys, with 120 unique characters, some friendly and some hostile. Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters. There are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you. Even some of the herbivores like elephants, rhino and hippos can do you serious harm if you trespass on their territory and they feel threatened. You will need water and three types of food to survive, but you will also need to look after your happiness. Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. The game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.

Use real gadgets in a real location, a house investigated by the game developers several times, on the request of three different owners. It is a case worthy of a video game, so welcome to Incubus. Uncover the reason as to why this house is always empty. Is it cursed? Many have come and gone from the house, citing malevolent forces play within the empty rooms, a sinister hunched figure has been seen in the corner of the eye and the place is a hotspot for paranormal activity. Will you survive the night? What makes a haunted house? It's no Dracula's Castle to look at, but neither is the house made famous by the Enfield Poltergeist or the scary monk that haunts the seemingly innocent looking 30 East Drive. Keep an open mind, investigate the house, and see and hear what ghosts may linger at 6 Dread Pit Road, in London's 'East End'. To solve the mystery of 'House 6' you must keep your eyes and ears open, and learn how to use ghost-hunting gadgets to pinpoint activity. There have been many tenants who have lived in 'House 6', none stayed very long and few have anything good to say. Quite the opposite, for over the years 'House 6' has accumulated a lot of eye witness statements and terrified testimonials. Here are a few: 'Coming home, I could hear someone upstairs, an obvious intruder! I snuck next door and phoned the police, who arrived within the hour. By now lights had come on upstairs, as the burglars searched the place. The police had a look around, but found no-one. How's that possible?!!' K. Taylor, 2020 'I awoke in the night, unable to move. Someone was pinning me to the bed. It was dark, but there was a figure, on top of me, like a nightmare. I tried to scream, but nothing came out, just weird! It lasted for about 5 minutes!! I felt the weight on my chest. Then nothing. It was morning, but I know it wasn't a dream.' E.Horton, 2007 'Yeah, that house!! I was supposed to decorate the place. Good money, should have been easy. But power issues, accidents, and Kenny falling off the ladder, none of that can be explained. It just isn't worth it. It's got something wrong with it. Bad energies.' Chris, 2004 'No, it hasn't sold, but we are keen to make a sale soon. We've heard all the stories, urban legends, and the spooky stuff. It's all nonsense, and here at Hoxton's we don't hire ghost-hunters to help sell a house, and if we did, we certainly wouldn't talk about it.' Hoxton's Real Estate Agent 2022 'It needs pulling down. There's something evil inside that house.' Barry, 2022 'I saw it! The figure at the window. It was ages ago, but I definitely saw it. Nasty eyes, they seem to catch the light, piercing horrible eyes, staring back at me. Some of us locals say it's the Devil. I've never passed that house since that day. People should stay away.' Gary, 1998 'We all witnessed the 'thing'. Hunched, hairy, snarling. It wasn't a person, no way, it moved too quick, and it stank, like wet dog. A dead wet dog! No, there was nothing human about it. We all saw it, and then it disappeared. We didn't wait to see if it came back.' Sarah, 1987 Features: A real haunted house, captured in detailed 360 views.

Yes, only if you're not good at it 'Simple' as in straightforward. Later levels in the game can be quite challenging There's a story but it's not shoved in your face NPCs don't keep you for too long. They don't beat around the bush or waste your time trying to be funny Some NPCs have a line of dialogue. Others might even be wearing hats.

The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew. Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did. All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.

Drox Operative is a starship action RPG with warring alien races, fierce space battles, a dynamic, evolving galaxy, and co-op multiplayer for Windows and Mac. Eons ago the Drox ruled the galaxy through their mighty Operatives. These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating. Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative. In the new space race, the major races are scouting, colonizing, and expanding, trying to take over the galaxy by diplomacy, technology, war, or any other means their scheming minds can contemplate. As a Drox Operative it's NOT your job to manage all of those annoying people, build thousands of buildings, play nice with your enemies, or balance the budget. It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe.

The game features an artstyle based around poorly made digital and physical art, featuring stickman characters and an abundance of obvious perfect circles and lines. Journey with Bob and friends to rid the world of the Evil King. However, things aren't always as simple as they seem. Bob is an Average Joe who lives in Circle Town with his wife, Suzy.

When Bob comes home from Day 1 of training to find a note saying Suzy has been kidnapped by the 'Evil King,' Bob rushes off to save his lover, meeting friends and foes along the way.

How about a slime in a mech suit? What about a tornado with a face or a small moon? Canvas Quest has those bases covered.
