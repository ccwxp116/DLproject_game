The story starts there as the duo reaches the city limits . What is the nature of the dreamworld that everyone is connected to ? What is the true nature of logomancy ? Is the emotion felt for a fictional character different from the emotion felt for a real person ? Did the ancient peoples of Callosum like slow - roasted brisket ? The Logomancer is a JRPG without killing . Conflicts are resolved through argumentation , logical discourse and persuasive speech . Mastering the elements of rhetoric will allow you to make your point to even the most stubborn audience . The people you meet are your ' weapons ' and the skills they teach your ' magic ' . Why not befriend an old editor and learn about the power of Proofreading ? Or assist a schizophasic blacksmith to learn how to Doublespeak ? In the world of the Logomancer , everyone is connected to a communal dreamworld known as the Mindscape . During sleep , everyone interacts together inside this strange mental world . The mind is a powerful tool in the world of dreams and the few exceptional individuals with the ability to build dreamworlds for others to participate in are called Logomancers . Using the classical elements of persuasion , social interactions become rhetorical battles . A ' boss fight ' could just be trying to convince a store owner to give you a new suit free of charge . This means that stats like ' persuasion ' , ' confidence ' , and ' elocution ' are much more important than ' strength ' , ' dexterity ' , or ' magic attack ' . If you ' ve ever wanted to play a Final Fantasy 6 - styled JRPG wherein you could improve your characters ' Perspicacity , then this game is probably for you . The Logomancer draws inspiration from the following sources , so if any of these pique your interest , there ' s a good chance there ' s something for you in this game : The Lost Room , Inception , Dark Souls , Final Fantasy 6 , Persona 4 , House of Leaves , Silent Hill 2 , and the music of two DTs - Dream Theater and Dark Tranquillity .

Anomalies may be a game , then again it may not . One user described it as ' A million musical leeches , waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain . ' Another said ' I don ' t even know what to say about this one . It honestly freaked me out a little . ' A particularly enthusiastic user stated ' Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing . . . I ' m pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe . ' A Fine Art Game Anomalies is an experimental generative art game . There are no levels , points or objectives . It is a ' game ' in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime , an interactive piece of audio - visual , virtual sculpture , which one can tinker around with and explore . Generate and Explore You can randomly generate the anomalies , or you can change the anomaly ' s parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation . Use the controls to explore Anomalies , and the unique sights and sounds they generate . Sights and Sounds Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena , the parameters that effect one effect the other . Some are strange and discordant entities , while others are symmetrical and harmonious . All the images and ' songs ' you hear in the demo video were produced through the program ' s algorithms . Other Options Using a built in screen capture button , you can collect snapshots of your handiwork . Use it as desktop wallpaper , or share it with your friends . If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly , you can also save it and load it again later . There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically , allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show . Experimental I call Anomalies ' experimental ' because of the way in which I developed it . I started with a simple idea - ' what would trees look like if they grew in space ? ' - and began to create fairly simple , branching structures . Once that was working , I thought about different colors and textures . Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - ' what if they move or wiggle ? What it they make sounds ? What if they produce flames or particles ? ' - and so on , until I arrived at what you see in the program . So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it . Though I have moved on to other projects , I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies . I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point , but I will not give any promises right now . . .

The Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place is a short , interactive tale about a building eater consuming a tower on the edge of the town of Matsyapura . Using a blend of descriptive text and surrealist visuals it is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history . In 1 9 6 0 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra , the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states . Mir UmarHassan , the fabled Gujarati poet , lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem titled : The Building Eaters of Matsyapur , he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the creation of a populace that is devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past . With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya , and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan ' s original poem . Created with support from Phoenix , Leicester . A site - specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix , Leicester . And at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago .

In SPAZ 2 you must survive in an evolving post apocalyptic Galaxy . The zombie threat is defeated , infrastructure has collapsed , fuel is scarce , and scavenging means survival . Initially the Galaxy contains hundreds of fleets , each trying to survive . AI captains do everything the player can . The player is not special and is not the center of the Galaxy . As resource scarcity becomes critical , ships come into conflict just to survive . Factions may form for protection or split due to starvation . Old friends must become fodder . Stronger factions establish and defend territories , set up resource hubs , and establish star bases . Weaker factions may resort to banditry . Each captain is unique , persistent , and shapes the Galaxy . When factions meet , combat is usually the result . While the strategic side of SPAZ 2 is about exploration , territorial control , and faction building , the action side of SPAZ 2 is about ship construction , tactics , and salvage . Combat creates damaged ships and dead crew , but it also provides new salvaged parts . All the parts in SPAZ 2 are modular and randomly generated . If you see something you like , break it off an enemy , grab it with your tractor beam , and connect it to your ship . Ship construction can be done live during battles , though sometimes beating an enemy to death with their broken wing is also fun . Back on the star map , battles will attract other captains looking for salvage . Take your new parts and run . Upgrade , repair , and prepare to fight another day , for darker threats are about to emerge . Key Features : Two hundred persistent Captains that are able to do everything the player can , including forming dynamic factions , building structures , controlling territory , and going to War . A true living galaxy that is not player centric . It will develop differently each game through the interactions of the agents . Build your own faction from nothing . Randomly generated modular parts . Build the mothership that suits your play style , on the fly , in seconds . Every part has its own unique stats that contribute to the mothership . Every part has its own hull integrity and damage states . Every part is a real , working , ship component . Strategic ship building . The mass , location and shape of parts all matter . If a part blocks a turret , it will not fire . If a ship is too long , it will turn slowly . Too many engines will mean too little power for weapons . Every design choice counts . A fully physics based 3 d environment where everything is destructible , takes damage from impacts , can be grabbed and even thrown at enemies with the tractor beam . Natural movement and controls . Movement is on a 2 d plane and screen relative , much like an FPS . The combat feels like huge pirate ships battling on an ocean . Focus on tactical positioning and manage system power to unleash hell at the right moment . Epic ship to ship battles . Tear the enemy apart piece by piece over minutes , instead of seconds .
Void Ninja is VR action platformer with gesture based controls and few innovative locomotions . Run , glide , dive and hook . Slice and arrow the enemies . Randomly generated levels . Design your own challenges .

There are plenty of games that explore being a super - powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite different game about the more interesting , deeper , and more subtle aspects of being a spy . The current main gameplay mode is 1 v 1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer , although there is limited single - player Sniper play right now , and a single player Spy and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot . See the SpyParty Steam Discussions for an FAQ and links to more information . If you ' re wondering where the MacOS X port went , see that FAQ ! I need to delay it until after SEA launch because I hit a few technical snags , but the non - Steam MacOS will continue to work , and I ' ll get it working on Steam soon after SEA launch hopefully !
